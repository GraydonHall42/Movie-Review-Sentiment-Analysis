"Eddie Brock gets a chance to interview Cletes Kasady (Woody Harrelson) abused as a child and serial killer as an adult. In looking at the graffiti on his cell walls, Venom is able to figure out where the bodies are buried. The death penalty is reinstated as Cletus head for lethal injection. Cletus also has a love interest in Francis Barrison (Naomie Harris) aka ""the shriek: because of her high pitch deadly voice. On Brock's final visit to Cletus, he infects the serial killer with a piece of Venom which turn him into Carnage who goes on a rampage of revenge.I didn't like this as much as the first film. The climax fight scene had multiple sides and lasted an inane amount of time with equally inane action. I guess this is what audiences' want. I liked seeing Woody not acting old. I thought someone like Octavia Spencer would have made an interesting Francis Barrison.Guide: 1 F-word. No sex or nudity unless you notice that Venom doesn't wear pants.",positive
"If you had issues with the first one and the (low) level of violence it had (PG13 and all that), do not expect this to be any better. This also is PG13. Since I am not too aware of Venom as he was depicted in the comics, I was free of that and quite enjoyed the first one.And while the bonus scene in the end credits of the first Venom movie hinted at Woody Harrelson being the main bad guy in this one (with a now different look for no reason I can think of), he is quite underused to be honest. The main focus of the movie relies on the relationship of Venom and Tom Hardys character. The side story is the love story between Harrelsons character and a woman with an ability ... that should open quite a few doors emotionally and otherwise, but never gets fully explored ... because people have to fight and CGI and all that.So the human drama only works between Hardy and Venom - everything else (even the cop) are side notes at best. Having said all that, the movie works if you don't mind those things too much and cut it some slack. It still feels like a step back from the previous entry.That is until the ending. And I don't mean the end fight (although the CG is quite stunning all things considered) ... I am talking about the bonus scene in the credits. I am not going to tell you what happens and I really hope you can watch it without knowing. As with the looking into the future that the first Venom had in store for us ... this does too! But with quite the promise ... although depending on how you feel about ... certain things you may feel different than me. Still it has to be seen to be believed! Oh the hype is real - and that bonus scene almost made me give this a bigger/higher rating too ...",positive
"The first film was an okay anti-superhero spin-off movie from Marvel for the famous enemy of Spider-Man, I didn't expect very much from the follow-up, but I was up for going to see it anyway, directed by Andy Serkis. Basically, in the opening flashback, in 1996, young Cletus Kasady (Jack Bandeira) is helplessly separated from his love, Frances Barrison (Olumide Olorunfemi), who has the ability of sound manipulation, when she is taken away from St. Estes Home for Unwanted Children to the Ravencroft Institute. On the way, Barrison uses her sonic scream powers to escape and attacks young police officer Patrick Mulligan (Sean Delaney). The officer shoots Barrison in the eye and her scream causes an injury to his ear, he assumes she is dead, but is taken to a facility with sound-proof walls. In the present, Detective Mulligan (Stephen Graham) contacts investigative journalist Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) to speak to serial killer Kasady (Woody Harrelson), who refuses to talk to anyone other than Brock following their interview a year ago. Brock, still living with alien symbiote Venom, has his career boosted by Venom figuring out where Kasady's murder victims bodies' are hidden. Brock later meets his ex-fiancée Anne Weying (Michelle Williams) who tells him that she is now engaged to Dr. Dan Lewis (Reid Scott), much to Venom's displeasure. Kasady was previously found guilty of his crimes and sentenced to death by lethal injection; he invites Brock over to San Quentin State Prison to attend his execution. Meeting on death row, Kasady provokes Venom, with numerous insults directed at Brock. Kasady bites Brock's hand, ingesting a small part of the symbiote. Back home, Venom and Brock argue as the alien wants more freedom and to eat bad people, and their fight ends with the symbiote detaching from his body. During Kasady's execution, the red symbiote emerges and blocks the injection, and infecting the criminal's body goes on a violent rampage through the prison, freeing inmates and killing guards. The red symbiote, calling itself Carnage, makes a deal with Kasady, to help him break out Barrison aka Shriek (Naomie Harris) from Ravencroft, and Kasady will help him eliminate Brock and Venom. Mulligan calls Brock and warns him about the situation. In Ravencroft, Kasady frees Barrison, they embrace and travel to their old children's home to burn it down. Mulligan, suspicious of Brock due to his interactions with Kasady before his escape, takes Brock to the police station. Brock refuses to answer Mulligan's questions and contacts Weying as his lawyer. Brock reveals that Venom has separated from him and needs him back to fight Carnage together. Venom has made his way to San Francisco, hopping from body to body, and is embracing his freedom. Eventually Weying finds him and bonds with him, after convincing him to forgive Brock, as the head to break Brock out of the police station. Brock and Venom make amends and reform. Kasady takes Mulligan hostage, and Barrison, failing to find Brock, kidnaps Weying. Lewis was given a message from Barrison about their whereabouts, to give to Brock, as they plan to get married at a cathedral. There, Venom appears and fights Carnage, holding his own against his spawn, who has strong disagreements with Kasady. Barrison seemingly kills Mulligan by hanging, and Venom is eventually overpowered brutally by Carnage, who decides to kill Weying at the top of the cathedral. But Venom regains his strength and saves Weying and provokes Barrison to use her powers, as her sonic blast causes both symbiotes to separate from their hosts. This causes the cathedral to collapse and Barrison falls to the ground and is killed by a falling bell. Venom saves Brock by bonding with him before the impact. Carnage tries to bond with Kasady again, but Venom devours the symbiote. Kasady says that he only wanted to be Brock's friend, but Venom bites Kasady's head off. While Brock, Venom, Weying, and Lewis escape, Mulligan is still alive, his eyes flash blue. Brock and Venom decide to take a vacation while they think about what will happen next. As Venom tells Brock about other universes, a blinding light transports them from their hotel room to another room, and they watch a news report with J. Jonah Jameson (J. K. Simmons) revealing the identity of Spider-Man as Peter Parker (Tom Holland), to which Venom takes an interest. Also starring Peggy Lu as Mrs. Chen, Sian Webber as Dr. Pazzo and Reece Shearsmith as Priest. Hardy is likeable as both the ordinary reporter and the amusingly snarly being in his body, Harrelson has fun being the camp villain, Harris is interesting if perhaps underwritten, and Graham doesn't do much. As with the original film, the special effects are brilliant to propel the fast-paced chase, fight and explosive sequences and bring to life unworldly creatures, it has great comedic sparring with no-holds-barred language, it is a warped buddy movie style story that works the slightest bit better than its predecessor, predictable and flimsy at times, but a reasonable superhero fantasy action horror. Worth watching!",positive
"The story is pretty engaging, and the visual effects are phenomenal. There's comedy in the symbiosis. The story offers much tension too. I enjoyed it more than I expected.",positive
"I was really looking forward to this. I enjoyed the first one and the trails for this sequel looked fun... What happened? It is all over the place. It starts off promisingly enough with an enjoyable set piece with ""Eddie"" (Tom Hardy) and Michelle Williams (""Anne"") - aided by some pithy one-liners from an unseen ""Venom"" but after we are introduced to ""Cletus"" (Woody Harrelson) the thing really hits the skids. The entertaining elements from the first film, the humour and - dare I say it, the symbiotic relationship/tolerance of man and amoeba are thrown under the bus for this angry CGI fest. Add to this pretty dry mix the rather pointless character of Harrelson's childhood sweetheart ""Frances"" (Naomie Harris) alias ""the Scream"" (remember the symbiotes don't like fire of sound), with her own agenda against copper ""Mulligan"" (Stephen Graham) and the whole thing just boils down to a very good looking film - but one with a plot that was almost non-existent, and that robbed the formidably sarcastic ""Venom"" of much of the charm that made the original work. Come to think on it - Hardy hardly features at all. I didn't hate it - it has a pace that passes 90 minutes effortlessly enough, but sorry, I was really disappointed.",negative
"Eddie Brock(Hardy, still delivering on the physical, living up to his namesake(as in ""Laurel and""), and loving playing Venom) wants to rebuild his career, so it doesn't take much to convince him to meet with imprisoned serial killer Cletus Kasady(Harrelson, who ""Knox"" it out the park). Maybe he can help find the remaining missing bodies? Unfortunately, this leads to... Carnage.This is at least as big of a mess as the first one was. It's less ironically fun, because this time it's on purpose. Then again, it is also substantially more enjoyable for that same reason. It's been a long time since I've seen something that had such wild writing. Try to go in knowing as little as possible. You will definitely not guess the places it goes. The comedy is much more successful, with the highlights being Ms Chen(Lu, master of the deadpan. Please give her a spin-off. You don't even have to take her out of her convenience store. Have her just react to bizarre things that happen right in front of her) and Anne(Williams, way more into it this time, which is definitely in part down to the incredible material they give her). It's hard to overstate how hilarious these two are. The action and CG is a lot better. If all you really want out of this is to see these iconic characters in live action, it will deliver on that. If you can roll with how ridiculous it is, as I did, you will be extremely entertained. If you cannot, this is going to exhaust you, and that is the only way that the 88(!) minute running time(if you don't count the end credits, and since those have only one additional scene(which is mindblowing), and it comes soon after they start running, you might as well leave the moment you've seen that one. The cinema staff will be grateful for it) won't fly by, to the point that it'll seem like you just sat down and then the movie ended. In fact, in that case, it will probably feel twice as long as it is, if not more.This features disturbing content, with a lot of implied violence and gore. I recommend this to anyone who thinks it will be their kind of thing. 7/10.",positive
"Eddie Brock is secretly hosting alien symbiote Venom. In practice, this means getting his apartment trashed regularly while trying to persuade his roomie to eat live chickens rather than bite peoples heads off. When he interviews serial killer Cletus Cassidy, a smidgen of symbiote combines with Cassidy to create pyscho-super-alien Carnage. And Cassidy's mutant girlfriend adds complications...I came out of the first Venom movie confused by its combination of violence, brutality, superheroics, and humour. This time I knew what to expect, and found myself laughing out loud quite often - much of the dialogue between Eddie and Venom is very funny, and Mrs Chen is an utter hoot.The film progresses along largely predictable lines, with lots of action and effects, mostly very well done (there are aome moments where it looked as if they ran out of time to complete the effects). There is plenty of scope for continuing the (sub)-franchise, especially given Tom Hardy's wholehearted and enthusiastic involvement (co-producer and story material). In fact, everyone looks to be having a ball.And, of course, the mid-credits scene is a real teaser!",positive
"I was thoroughly disappointed with ""Venom: Let There be Carnage"". It was such a botched job from the beginning I wonder what was the thought process behind it.The movie begins with a scene from 1996 at an orphanage or some such place. A girl named Frances Barrison was removed from there because her powers had become too dangerous. In short order we find that she has powers similar to Banshee in that her scream is loud enough to cause damage. Her forcible removal from the institution drove her soulmate, Cletus Kasady, mad.We fast-forward to present day and Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) is single again. Apparently, things didn't work out between him and Anne (Michelle Williams). That part was fine, but what wasn't was the new Chatty Cathy Venom we had to endure. Here is this sinister, brain-eating, alien symbiote that wants to be a comedian ALL THE TIME. It was flat out amazing how much Venom talked, and not in a good way. He doesn't have the voice for comic relief, yet that's what he was attempting to be and he was failing miserably. But Venom's attempts at stand-up paled in comparison to the fat-fingered manner in which they brought about Venom's antagonist Carnage.Present day Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson) was a condemned man.And if I could just sidebar for a second: casting sixty-year-old Woody Harrelson as the antagonist in this movie was such a terrible choice. He was supposed to be fifty at the absolute oldest and he looked terrible in the hairpiece and flashy clothing.OK, back to the story. Cletus was such a prolific killer, the governor reversed the moratorium on the death penalty especially for him. Before his execution date, Cletus wanted to get a message to Frances (Naomie Harris) who was serving time in a cell specially made for her and her powers. Cletus promised Eddie a full story if he would print one simple message on the front page of his paper. Eddie agreed because a full story from an infamous serial killer is career-making. When Eddie visited with Cletus Venom was able to gather a few visual clues to help Eddie find all of Cletus's buried victims without a word from Cletus. This propelled Eddie to newspaper stardom and sealed Cletus's fate. In this very elementary way Eddie became Cletus's nemesis.Cletus wanted to see Eddie one last time before his execution to antagonize him for unearthing his secrets. Somehow, through knowledge Cletus divined from thin air, Cletus began ridiculing Eddie on a personal level that would require a fairly intimate knowledge of Eddie's past. This level of ridicule triggered Venom and he attacked Cletus. Cletus then grabbed Eddie's hand and bit him hard enough to draw blood. That blood, now on Cletus's lips, had enough alien matter in it to be the key ingredient for what happened next.When Cletus was pumped full of the lethal injection cocktail it mixed with his small bit of alien essence and created Carnage; an alien symbiote even more powerful than Venom. Carnage then made a grand exit from San Quentin Prison and we now had a CGI battle between two aliens that could not have been more forced.Let me recap: Frances aka Screech separated from Cletus. Cletus becomes a homicidal maniac. Cletus bites Eddie because he's that crazy. Eddie's blood with a small amount of alien matter is now in Cletus. Cletus gets injected with lethal cocktail and becomes Carnage. Venom fights Carnage to the death.This is a story that maybe gets a fifth grader an A, but a high-schooler an F. This is not the sort of shoddy movie-making I expect from Marvel, even if this isn't part of the MCU.",negative
"When we got to the climax and it felt like the movie just breezed by, I immediately added another star to my rating. A short super(anti)hero movie? AMAZING!Venom: Let There Be Carnage isn't a great movie and has ALL the clichés of most superhero movies, but it was enjoyable. I found myself laughing a lot at Venom's one-liners and again, I enjoyed how SWIFT this movie was. That was refreshing.Despite some exposition, this is one of those sequels YOU MUST see the first one to understand this universe. And that's too bad. I rated the first one 2/5 stars and didn't care for it much. This is absolutely the better of the two.Eddie Brock & Co. - or the alien symbiote, Venom - are still fighting over superiority when they have a break-up. Simultaneously, the guy who used to bartend at Cheers turns into both a supervillain and Venom's greatest foe. Will Eddie make up with Venom in time to stop the Carnage?Yes, this movie has the age-old Superhero trope I hate so dearly: ""I don't wanna be a superhero anymore! I quit!"" usually found in the second chapter. Superman II did it, The Dark Knight did it, Iron Man 2 did it, hell, Spider-Man 2 did it, just to name a few of hundreds of examples. I hate it with a passion. So, when it happened here, I tried to remain calm. Mercifully, when Venom's on his own, he does have some fantastic and hilarious scenes. This one gets a pass because we hardly ever get to see the other side of this equation. All we usually get is the whiney non-superhero.That and some of the lazy writing's are probably the most problems of this. Everything else was fine or actually good. No one was terrible and the special effects were 10x better than the original. Recommended.***Final Thoughts: My friend with me said: We have to wait for the mid-credit scene. The second he told me that, I knew 100% who was showing up. Despite that, listen to my friend. You need to see it.",positive
"I had a good time with this movie. It's fun and pretty funny with some entertaining action.It's also very messy with regards to the story, action and dialogue. The action isn't as good as the first. The story brings no value. And there were some stupid moments.I also can't stand that it's not rated R. I could say that about the first, but it did a great job of pushing the limits while also not having too many moments where it was obvious it would have been better with blood. This movie has SOOO many moments where it could have been amazing if they went all out. It felt so censored.I try to always have no expectations going into a movie. And i knew going in that even though i loved the first one, that doesn't make this one bulletproof. But looking back on it, a movie about carnage could have been so much more. It was underwhelming. Also i wish i got more development from cleetus and carnage.One more thing, tom hardy and andy serkis are awesome. But writing and directing are talents that very few have. I think it shows here and i would have preferred veterans at those crucial positions.I'll caveat this review by saying i couldn't understand a lot of the dialogue, especially from venom. We'll see if that changes anything when i watch it with subs. (1 viewing, 9/30/2021)",positive
"I wasn't expecting that much right before the movie came out. I actually really enjoyed it! This movie features Eddie Brock interviewing Cletus Kassidy and getting him executed. Cletus bites him and gets some substance from Venom's symbiote body and while about to be executed turns into the villain Carnage. I say that Carnage might be my favorite Spider-Man villain if only because he's the most evil. He actually does manage to get some sympathetic traits as he cares about his girlfriend as her powers aren't compatible with Carnage's.That's really an interesting idea for supervillain couples. Carnage doesn't appear until a half hour in and for a superhero (or mostly supervillain) movie, that's kind of short, but I still felt it got in what it needed to be. I admit it was weird seeing how goofy Venom and Eddie were interacting. They still worked, but weren't quite on type. The best part is of course, the scene at the very end.Venom's been teleported to the MCU. ***",positive
"Much like the protagonist in Venom: Let There Be Carnage, I feel like there were two different screenwriters battling about what this movie should be, and they didn't really communicate with each other. This sequel is a loud and frantic mess, where superpowers can do whatever the plot demands, characters don't care about consistency, and the same jokes are repeated a dozen times. If you liked the first Venom movie, you'll probably like this one. I didn't, so I don't.",negative
"I absolutely loved this sequel, I wish that it was R rated but still worth it in IMAX and with a cozy blanket. The action and humor are excellent delights throughout. Andy Serkis direction flowed perfectly with large budgeted carnage. Length is just right too has the right scenes needed nothing boring at all or otherwise. I'm impressed Tom Hardy voiced Venom, plays Eddie Brock, has a writing credit, and is a producer that's wild! Hope my thoughts are appreciated either way highly recommend this fun time experience.",positive
"Venom: Let There Be Carnage is an Action - Sci-Fi movie and the sequel of ""Venom"", in which we watch Eddie Brock going to interview a serial killer and later finding out that he is a host of another symbiote that helps him escape prison and the upcoming execution.Since I had already watched the first movie I knew what to expect from the second. I enjoyed it because it had a simple but interesting plot, plenty of action scenes that were combined very well with comedy and in general it was entertaining. Its short duration helped it to become interesting and not boring but if it would be rated with R it would be even better. The direction which was made by Andy Serkis was good and he followed the same pattern as in the first movie of ""Venom"" and his touch was obvious through the whole duration of the movie. The interpretations of Tom Hardy who played as Eddie Brock / Venom, Woody Harrelson who played as Cletus Kasady / Carnage and Naomie Harris who played as Frances Barrison / Shriek were very good. To sum up, I have to say that ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" is not a bad movie but I have to admit that I was a bit disappointed by it.",negative
"Marvel and DC these days remind me of those big players of the worldwide cheeseburger ""distribution network"" - the products always taste the same, because the ingredients are always accurately of the same nature and made the same way. Always. The same applies these days to those entertainment companies - you already know what to expect if a new show or movie leaves the factories of those big players of genetic movie engineering. Venom: Let There Be Carnage is not a candidate for the worst movie categories nor a total bore or fail, it is just a part of that endless and constant stream of ""entertainment"" these factories produce: easy to consume, easy to forget. Long gone are the times when I heard people talking about a new movie or show of those ""big"" players. Disappointed? No, it's just business as usual.",negative
"I didn't really like the first ""Venom"" film that much. I found the banter between Brock and his symbiote to be more wearing than entertaining and the conclusion a CGI constructed mess. I liked this sequel a little more, but I wouldn't go as far as saying that I thought it was good.Whilst interviewing serial killer Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson), some of Eddie Brock's (Tom Hardy) symbiotic blood is introduced to Kasady's system. This goes on to generate Carnage, a powerful red symbiote charged with the psychosis of its host. Escaping from prison, Carnage tries to rescue Kasady's long term girlfriend Francis Barrison (Naomie Harris) and then find a way to get their revenge on Brock. However, Brock and Venom are not finding life together particularly copacetic.I really wanted to get there this time, to like this one. I like Andy Serkis, I like how committed to playing the character Tom Hardy is, acting as a producer this time and getting his friend Kelly Marcel to return to write the film with him. I liked the cameo roles for British actors, Rosie Marcel, Scroobius Pip and most high profile, Reece Shearsmith, in a role that was a real surprise, as I don't think he's talked about it anywhere.But I just didn't manage it. The bickering between Brock and Venom is rarely (but not never) funny, and again becomes tiresome quite a lot of the time. There's a lot or praise for the tight runtime, but I felt that came at the expense of the story, which is really basic and leads to the under utilisation of several characters - most notably Naomie Harris' Shriek villain, who appears retrofitted into the story to make the conclusion work. I understand the change in Carnage's origins, in order to differentiate the film from the first one, but I didn't like it. The CGI work isn't particularly amazing and the final fight has been done before.The post credits scene was intriguing, but for me, I'm as excited that the character can get into the hands of better storytellers, as for the actual reveal of it.",negative
"I saw ""Venom:Let There Be Carnage"", starring Tom Hardy-Peaky Blinders_tv, The Revenant; Woody Harrelson-the Zombieland movies, the Hunger Games movies; Michelle Williams-The Greatest Showman, Brokeback Mountain and Naomie Harris-the Bond movies, Miami Vice_2006.This is a sequel to the 2018 Venom movie with some extra umph-It's better than the first one. Venom has a child, Carnage. Tom returns as Eddie Brock, the host for the alien symbiote Venom. Woody plays a serial killer named Cletus Kasady that becomes the host to Venom's off shoot, Carnage, and since Woody is a little on the nuts side, you can imagine how wack_o Carnage can be. Michelle returns as Tom's ex girlfriend that just wants to be friends with Tom-as most girls do-when she decides to marry another guy. Naomie plays Woody's girlfriend that has some attributes herself. There are lots of battles between the two symbiotes that look great. It's directed by Andy Serkis who has some impressive screen credits of his own: He has played villains in the Marvel Universe, Gollum in the lord of the Rings movies and Caesar in the Planet of the Apes movies. Some of the violence is a little gruesome.There is a scene just as the end credits start-nothing at the very end-that connects to another franchise.It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, action and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 30 minutes.I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",positive

"Venom: Let there be Carnage (2021) is a movie the wife and I saw last week in theatres. The movie focuses on serial killer Cletus Cassidy and his rough upbringing. When Eddie Brock is chosen to be his reporter, and Cassidy takes a bite of him, the symbiote suit on Brock breaks off and infects Cassidy creating a ruthless killer like never seen before. Can Brock and Venom stay on the same page long enough to bring him down? This movie is directed by Andy Serkis (Heavenly Sword) and stars Tom Hardy (Bronson), Woody Harrelson (Natural Born Killer), Naomi Harris (28 Days Later), Michelle Williams (Blue Valentine) and Stephen Graham (Snatch). The storyline for this is very compelling and is well written from a plot to character standpoint. The dialogue is first rate and hilarious as are the special effects, which are fantastic. The CGI fits the comics to perfection. The action scenes from beginning to end are wondeful; my one complaint, this is the darkest and most violent and gruesome Marvel comic series, and every kill and gore sequence is hidden by random things like cut away scenes or random tornados 🌪 to hide what are gruesome kills in the comic. The dialogue makes up for it but the lack of showing the kills keeps this from being the masterpiece it had the potential to be. This is a worthwhile sequel I would score a 7.5/10.",positive
"It's been a busy week but I have finally found the time to watch Venom: Let There Be Carnage and now here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees Eddie Brock and Venom have to figure out their relationship while going against a serial killer and his own symbiote.Main Character Tom Hardy plays Eddie Brock and voices Venom and he does a pretty good job. I just find his performance as Brock entertaining and clearly somebody who is enjoying himself. He doesn't get much character development but I think there is just about enough here to give Hardy props for his role in the film. Venom is actually given more development and it is executed pretty well, I actually felt feeling towards the symbiote. He is also pretty funny and for me the dynamic between Venom and Eddie Brock is probably the highlight of the film.Supporting Characters The first Venom film suffered from not creating interesting supporting characters and it is a shame that this film is the same. Woody Harrelson reprises his role of Cletus Kassidy/Carnage from the post credit scene of the first film and I just never got invested in his character. He just came across as a weirdo and a guy with no character. Harrelson is clearly enjoying himself but the character of Carnage is not given the justification that he deserves here. Naomi Harris plays Shriek and unfortunately, she is even worse. She just has these terrible one liners and her over the top bizarre performance is just too much for me and does nothing for me. The great Stephen Graham plays a police officer and it's not even that he is bad, he is actually alright but his character is dull and there is literally no reason to care and it is a shame that such a talent is wasted here. Michelle Williams is back as Anne from the first film and she is just as boring here, I just don't like the character and I have felt like Williams phones it in and signed a contract that she had to be here as she does very little here.Story The relationship between Eddie and Venom is represented quite well here and I like how we saw more things from Venom's point of view this time around. But it is flawed, the dynamic between Carnage and Venom fails and the dynamic between Brock and Cassidy doesn't work either. The characters don't get enough time to develop and you won't care about anybody apart from Venom and maybe Eddie.Script The script is okay, the humour was something I was worried about in the trailer but I can't deny that it worked for me. I chuckled quite a few times with Venom having some funny one liners. But the drama falls really flat and is so rushed that when it comes to the big showdown I kind of didn't care.Style Both Venom and Carnage both look great and the clash between them is way easier to follow then the action in the first film. But the pacing is all over the place, it starts off at 100 miles an hour and then slows down and ties to focus on way too much. It needed a longer runtime to make the audience care about the characters.Overall Overall, Venom; Let There Be Carnage is an average film that doesn't rise above its predecessor. It is okay and I don't think will bring any new fans but there is a huge post credit scene and that is all that people will be talking about coming out of this film.",positive
". . . alleges this foreign film from Sony. VENOM: LET THERE BE CARNAGE savagely besmirches actor Woody H., the beloved Crusader from ZOMBIELAND. (If Sony decides to attack Rome like they're currently assaulting America, they'll probably turn Mother Teresa into a serial killer, too!) This misogynist exercise also dismisses its trio of leading female characters as fickle shrieking chocolate hoarders. If you're a loyal patriotic true blue citizen, you should avoid VENOM like the Plague!",negative
I'm soooooooo tired of WOODY Harrelson in every fricking movie especially when he plays the villain. Hes just not intimidating he doesn't look like a villian come on hes made for zombieland. Those movies he is great but hes absolutely HORRIBLE in venom he is out of place his lines aren't villainous at all he is not intimidating or just plane old doesn't fit the part. Tom hardy is as always PHENOMENAL but this is venon it needs to be like deadpool it HAS TO BE R RATED!!!! It was just ok wait for it to stream see 007 instead.,negative
"Tom Hardy returns in this current sequel to the 2018 original. Now finding a sort of peaceful co-existence w/the Venom symbiote, Eddie Brock, Hardy, has gotten his life sort of back on track (being an ace reporter again & living w/the fact his ex, again played by Oscar nominee Michelle Williams, has moved on). Into this fractious détente comes a call from a death row inmate, played again by Oscar nominee Woody Harrelson (who cameo'd in the last film), to tell his tale (where we've seen in flashback Harrelson's romance w/another disturbed inmate, played by Oscar nominee by Naomi Harris, cut short when she used her power, a banshee type scream to escape during a prison transfer but gets shot by a cop but not before deafening him). W/Harrelson's story published, he believes his & Hardy's life are entwined even inviting him to his last meal where he takes an opportunity to bite Hardy thus infecting him w/Venom & creating Carnage (which prompts an explosive outbreak from prison) whose sole goal is to reunite w/Harris & take revenge on their foes. Definitely better that the first film now directed by ace mo-cap performer Andy Serkis but it still has an air of 'what for?' hovering above it since Venom doesn't exist, at least for me, w/o the presence of Spider-man so the film ends up being an unabashed cash grab w/o a hint of irony or subtlety. Even the well done special effects, particularly the fidelity of the sound, started to rattle me physically where I felt I was being bombarded on a neutron level. Also starring Stephen Graham as the aggrieved detective.",negative
"Wednesday uses Uncle Fester in her experiment for a science fair run by Cyrus Strange. Morticia and Gomez take the family on a road trip and Wednesday is not too happy. Cyrus Strange now claims to be her biological father in a switched-at-birth accident. Gomez tries to stay ahead of Strange's lawyer and keep it secret from Wednesday.I do love these characters but I also wonder if most of that love comes from the live action movies. I do wish that they use some of the live action actors for the voices. As for this story, it's good to center it on Wednesday but it does make the rest of the family more like supporting characters. The better drama is probably Wednesday being kidnapped and the family working together to rescue her. For this movie, the middle meanders around. Their stops are rather random. They go to Niagara Falls instead of Salem. It's not the best choice. I do like the fish-out-of-water aspect of going to Miami beach. This seems to be trying to be Vacation or something. It's not really that good but I still love these characters.",positive
"This story centers on Wednesday as the family takes their version of a Winnebago across country. A scientist in California believes Wednesday is his biological daughter separated at birth when Uncle Fester played juggle the babies in the infirmary. The parents are attempting to keep this a secret from her, but Wednesday is too clever.The cartoon was pun filled, too many to catch in one viewing. It brought a smile to my face.",positive
"Outside of the main plot, ""The Addams Family 2"" is pretty much what I expected. No masterpiece, but nothing terrible. Worth mentioning that there are some jokes that only adults will understand.",negative
"Well, if you enjoyed the 2019 animated movie ""The Addams Family"" then you will most certainly also enjoy this 2021 sequel titled ""The Addams Family 2"".It was quite enjoyable to see that the animated movie kept the originality, humor and odd art style that was seen in the 2019 movie, which made for a great sense of familiarity and continuity.The storyline told in ""The Addams Family 2"" is spooky and ooky - see what I did there? Yup, the storyline was one that was every bit as fun and enjoyable as it was something that certainly had that particular Addams Family magic to it. There is something for the entire family to be enjoyed here in this 2021 animated movie, kids and adults alike.It should be said that the art style is quirky, but I found it to be rather enjoyable. And yeah, the art style definitely match the oddity that is the Addams Family, so it was spot on yet again. The animation is good and fluid, and there is an abundance of great details to be noticed in the scenes, which does make for an interesting second viewing of the movie.There is a good amount of fun and laughs throughout the course of the entire movie.With ""The Addams Family 2"" being an animated movie, of course having a good voice cast is crucial. And believe you me, they certianly had that with this one. The voice actors and actresses were so well-cast for the individual roles, and it was quite an impressive ensemble, with the likes of Oscar Isaac, Charlize Theron, Chloë Grace Moretz, Nick Kroll, Bette Midler, Bill Hader and Wallace Shawn.""The Addams Family 2"" is an animated movie that certainly is watchable for Halloween, just as it an animated movie that just as easily can be enjoyed the rest of the year. Me and my family were genuinely entertained by this 2021 animated movie.My rating of ""The Addams Family 2"", from directors Greg Tiernan, Conrad Vernon and Laura Brousseau lands on a six out of ten stars.",negative
"Whilst I didn't actually hate this film, I really left the cinema wondering just who it was made for? The youngsters at the screening were soon bored and though there are a few jokes hidden away for the adults, we were not long in following them down this path of colourfully animated, but really pretty lacklustre ennui. The story centres around ""Wednesday"" being lured by a mad scientist to share her body transfer formula with him. To achieve this end, he tries to convince her that she is not a true ""Addams"" and this tests all the family bonds and loyalties. The best scenes belong to ""Lurch"" - doing his best Gloria Gaynor on the piano in a bar full of maladjusted bikers, but otherwise it really is a pretty dull experience that shows off the animators art well, but much less so that of the screenwriters, the director or, particularly, the acting talents of Charlize Theron, Oscar Isaac or even the sparing appearances of ""Grandma"" (Bette Midler). I did quite like their motor-home though...",negative
"The animated version of The Addams Family got a sequel--as if there were any doubt it would. I think the word animation is synonymous with sequel because every one of them gets one.After fighting off Margaux Needler and winning over the town of Assimilation in the first one, The Addams Family has another crisis and Wednesday is at the center of it. A mad scientist from Sausalito is claiming that Wednesday (voiced by Chole Grace Moretz) is his daughter and she begins to believe that she just may have been switched at birth. This is a serious blow to Gomez (voiced by Oscar Isaac) and Morticia (voiced by Charlize Theron), but how can they fight scientific facts?I saw this one in the movie theater just to get out and do something with the kids. In that sense it was worth it. I don't think I make the same move pre-pandemic. ""The Addams Family 2"" was OK. I didn't think they needed to make an animated version in the first place, so naturally I believe a sequel is superfluous.",negative
2 out of 5 stars.No improvements over the last movie. An animated sequel that has yet to find any humor or memorable story. The adults may find the film boring.,negative
"The Addams family goes on vacation, only because a scientist is trying to capture Wednesday, and of course a fun series of misadventures follows along the way.A pretty good animated that goes a little edger cause it's an Addams Family movie. Actors Charlize Theron, Oscar Isaac, Chole Grace Moretz, all seem to fit there voices for there characters perfectly. Also manages to let other characters shine. Also surprises when you think it's gonna go one way but goes in another.",positive
"I saw ""The Addams Family 2"", starring the voices of Oscar Isaac-the Star Wars movies, All About the Benjamins; Charlize Theron-the Fast & Furious movies, The Legend of Bagger Vance; Chloe Grace Moretz-Shadow in the Cloud, The Equalizer and Bill Hader-Barry_tv, Trainwreck.This is a sequel to the 2019 animated version of the Addams Family saga. Oscar is still Gomez, Charlize is Morticia and Chloe is Wednesday-there is a different actor voicing Pugsley because Finn Wolfhard's voice changed . Oscar & Charlize are feeling that the kids are growing up and need a family vacation to reconnect so most of the time is spent traveling the USA in an RV-not just a regular RV, but an Addams family version. In a side plot, Bill plays a scientist that makes some accusations about one of the members of the Addams family's true heritage. Other celebrity voices doing cameos include Wallace Shawn, Nick Kroll, Snoop Dogg & Bette Midler.It's rated ""PG"" for rude humor, violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 33 minutes.If you liked the first one then you should enjoy this one. It's not one that I would buy-except for the grandkids-but it would be a good rental.",positive
"The Addams Family Values (2021) is a movie my daughter and I recently watched together at the movies. The storyline follows Wednesday becoming a teenager and getting sick of her parents, especially her over zealous dad. She starts to question if she's really an Addams at all. Dad tries to offset her concern by planning a family road trip hoping to rebuild their relationship. This movie is codirected by Greg Tiernan and Conrad Vernon, who worked together on Sausage Party, and contains the voices of Oscar Isaac (Star Wars: Last Jedi), Charlize Theron (Monster), Chloë Grace Moretz (Tom & Jerry), Bette Midler (Hocus Pocus) and Martin Short (Three Amigos). The animation in this remains outstanding and the storyline and circumstances were way better than the first film. The voices are well selected and the soundtrack was excellent too. Cousin It's guest appearance is brilliant as always. This picture captures the Addams universe perfectly and is a must see for fans of the horror family. I'd score this an 8/10 and strongly recommend it.",positive
". . . elementary school science fair project involving an erupting volcano. Pugsley Addams serves as a consultant for such an academic exercise early during ADDAMS FAMILY 2, and winds up destroying most of his school building. Later on he somehow manages to blow up most of the Grand Canyon, earning him eight consecutive life terms at Ft. Leavenworth for vandalizing a national park. Real Life rangers there have been predicting for years that such park features as Phantom Ranch and the two foot bridges crossing the Colorado River would be wiped out by the inevitable failure of the leaking Glen Canyon Dam. However, the water level in Lake Powell (a reservoir created by the dam in the 1960's) is now so low that IF the dam were to be destroyed by Pugsley Addams (or anyone else) its loss might not even be noticed by hikers and/or rafters downstream.",negative
"So disappointed with this horrendous mess.No one Laughed. Not once.The first film was such good fun with a nice story & lots of funny bits & plenty of charm but part 2 has one of the worst Scripts ever for an Animated movie.Instead of a fun-filled family vacation film (Similar to a ""Griswolds"" fun vacation film i thought but for kids) we get a big really false mess about Wednesday not being a real Addams & a silly & ridiculously unfunny side bit about Uncle Fester gradually turning into a massive octopus creature!!! Totally stupid & embarrassing unfunny. Not even the little kids Laughed at all.I found it so hard to sit through it as each embarrassing forced situation happened with no funnny bits at all.So annoying because it could've been such a fun vacation movie about the Addams Family getting into all types of mischief whilst visiting different places on a fun road trip but NO!!! We get a silly story about missing identity & a big damp squid.No character gets anything funny to do or say at all, I'm not joking. Uncle fester who was hilarious in the first film spends the whole time playing off of his tentacle arms as he's changing & it's embarrassing.Seriously one of the worst sequels ever & one of the worst Animated films ever in my opinion.",negative
"The Addams Family 2: The animated Addams are back! They go on a road trip around the US, starting with Niagra Falls which they traverse in barrels after Wednesday plays her voodoo doll tricks on Pugsley. But worse danger to family unity is afoot as a lawyer claims Wednesday was wrongly switched with another child at the maternity hospital. The road trip turns into a chase. Plenty of film references, Ma, Jaws, Carrie. Also song and dance numbers the best being Lurch playing the piano and singing I Will Survive. Wednesday splices octopus genes into Uncle Fester and he develops tentacles. There's a lot of gene-splicing going on in this film. Again, don't over analyse this feature, just enjoy it. 7/10.",positive
"Not as good as the original. But still cute as Wednesday is the main character as Morticia and Gomez take a backseat a bet as well as Fester and Pugsley there.As the family is being followed by a scientist hiring a lawyer and strongman throughout the movie there. To see if the scientist is Wednesday's biological father.And being smart and reading minds, the unusually stoic older Addams child is curious to see if the Addams family is her real family or that the scientist is using her for his own gain.In order to get away from them and spending time as the kids are becoming teens there, to go in a camper for three weeks on a road trip. Knowing it could be one of the few last times.Still not as good but cute nonetheless the sequel.",positive
"LIKES:Animation is Good: It's no Pixar or Walt Disney Studios, but the MGM studios has prepared a delightful adventure that moves fluidly, has that same quirky design, and is just a fun adventure to say the least. Despite the gruesome nature of the ghouls of this family, the animation is welcoming for all ages, dark enough to be enjoyed by fans of upper years, but still appropriate for the children of the group. The caricature nature of it has a certain charm to it, and the fact the fluid nature adds whimsy to it and does it so clean and fluid makes for a nice alternative to the bigger studios.Voice Acting: Much like the first film, I think the vocal performances are fine for the most part in this movie, still living true to the characters without coming off too stiff or one dimensional. Isaac's lead as Gomez is a nice mimicry of the classic roles, loud, boisterous, but still concerning and touching when called for. Charlize Theron is ready to bring the same poise and prim nature of Morticia that oozes the finesse of the lead female role, but again adds a slight layer of touching warmth that this installment calls for in the deeper lessons. Chloe Grace Moretz does a fantastic job with the monotone, depressed voice of Wednesday, delivering the sort of desolate and cold performance that was made famous year ago. It's that dark sass and grim outlook that sells the character's darker comedy, and she continues to pull it off quite well. Nick Kroll as well gets a nod for the imbecile of Fester. Though not the spirited performances of the past, he still captures the naïve idiocy of the Uncle, with that same charm and fun that all renditions have held long ago. I liked the expanded performance he brought in this film, that still kept to the roots, but also allowed new territory to be explored with this particular installment.The Better Character Utilization: Again, it's not the show or the Family Values we got long ago, but this second installment for this reboot did a much better job using most of its characters in a deep manor. Gomez's approach to new avenues of parenthood were better designed to show the care for his family's well-being. Morticia still took a large amount of the show, but again held elements that were charming, fun, and still true to the character's usual elegance. Wednesday got a much larger role, and past the typical bullying of Pugsley, actually had a little more sentiment behind it despite what the girl normally does. She was certainly the centerpiece, but it worked super well with the elements and I liked seeing the story take a closer look at what lies beneath the shell. Fester, Pugsley, Thing, and even Lurch were all given some expansion as well, and though still not taking the center stage, held a purpose and some great scenes that I think wins a nod of approval from me. As for Cousin It, much better use in this film, which though primarily laugh factor and merchandizing... still was enjoyable for me.The Comedy Mixture: True, this Addams family is geared to a much younger audience in humor with farting, slapstick, and plenty of stupid moments that they will want to watch again and again. However, there is still plenty of clever wit to the film if you keep your eyes open, including references to several quirks and tropes in the modern day. Pokes at the internet, the obsession with texting, insurance commercials, and even how nonsensical plots can get are just some of the jokes I particularly enjoyed. This mixture of both simple and complex jokes kept things interesting and fun, avoiding the traps of lazy writing that movies sometimes fall into and skirting the excessive territory quite well. Again, it is all in good fun and spirit, which I believe kids can handle with ease and grown-ups can stomach.The Deeper Morals: Hands down I enjoyed the story taking a stab at some more grown up story arcs for the movie. The main story is all about finding oneself and what it means to be a part of a family, something many of us have had to face in a lifetime. Wednesday's search for herself ends up bleeding into just about every character, and it was nice to see the chemistry of the family challenged past the typical ghouls in a human world motif. Pugsley's story may have been more for comedic purposes, but even there they scratched into a young boy trying to push past his awkwardness and dive into a new, yet familiar, stage of life. His work with Uncle Fester continues the plot from the first movie, and again expands in both laughs and emotional moments between them.DISLIKES: Incomplete Story Elements Still: Though I enjoyed the new story, and much of the expansion past the static tale of the first rendition, I still kind of felt this sequel did not touch on everything they could have. Pugsley's connection with his own parents is a bit limited for my tastes, and it seems like this time he was the afterthought of the family. Fester's comedic relief was fun, but his estrangement is still a bit isolating and not nearly as fleshed out as the live action movies we got back in the 90s. Yet the worst tale was the Grandmother's side hustle at home, which gets alluded to a few times but stops the roll before the snowball gets too big. Having those tangents set up a lot of fun jokes to use Bette Midler's voice talents, but that potential was dropped too quickly and seemed forgotten. Again, I'm all for creativity and fun, but execute the ordeal if you are going to make it a big point or don't include it.The Bad Guy: While he certainly brings that Addams family quality of disturbing bad guys with that twist that is really weird, it still needs some work. Part of it was trying to make a twist for them to surprise us with, which kind of failed, so I can understand. However, the movie's villain needed more screen time and shadowy behavior then what we got with him. There is a great joke to comment about how little the villain is used, but I for one really wanted to see more planning in his use and the same meticulous infiltration into the family's gullibility than what we got, which was mainly at the end of the movie. This would have included some tertiary and secondary characters getting more opportunity to shine and elude the mystery, and offer a chance for some interactions between Fester, Pugsley, and practically anybody else.The Ending: It's not how the tale finished that I disliked, but more so just how fast the ending hit. The second installment takes it's time and detours to help lay out the story and build up the obstacles to the family, only to have it all hit the ending too quickly. As I said in the villain section, there was not enough time or challenge by the antagonist to engage us in his threat, or even allow the Addams spirit to push their buttons. The whole conflict itself is rather simplistic and one sided, lacking the dark charm and finesse the live action movie had for solving the problem. Ture, it did bring a Fester plot point full circle to which I enjoyed several times, but still there was so much more that could have been done to extend on the fun at hand. Even the Bette Milder story seems like a tacked on add on, missing a really good closing number to put in a hasty end credits art piece.The VERDICT: Addams Family 2 turned into a better movie for me than the first attempt at rebooting this series. I liked how the movie moved so to speak, with fun animation and spirit to help liven up the fun and keep the tale from becoming stagnant. With better character utilization, mostly, clever jokes for all ages, and a deeper moral themed narrative, it's got a lot of strengths in the family movie night department, so long as you can take an alternative to Disney. Still, the movie does have some limitations that still need to be worked out for this reviewer. Side stories need to be eliminated or utilized better, alongside working on ironing out all creases in the family story line. I'd have liked to see the villain get more time and involvement with the plot, to help capture the dark and haunting charm this family always has with them. And more importantly not rush the ending and hastily tie up the tale they are working hard to tell. Still, this one was fun to watch at home, and if you had a group, could be a fun trip to the theaters. I encourage everyone giving this a look at in the future. My scores are:Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 7.5 Movie Overall: 6.5.",positive
"Get ready to take an action-packed road trip across America when the Addams family comes back for another wild adventure! The Addams Family 2 has a fantastic storyline, characters and animation as well as strong themes. Families of all ages should be super pumped for this relatable and fun new film.The Addams Family 2 has a fantastic storyline that is focused on Wednesday (Chloe Grace Moretz), who is stuck between two families, not sure which one she actually shares her DNA. She uses her impressive chemistry and scientific abilities to try to determine her destiny. Is her real father Gomez Addams (Oscar Isaac), who raised her, or the one who gives seemingly incontrovertible proof, Cyrus (Bill Hader). The battle is a constant inner conflict within Wednesday as she faces decisions that could change her life forever. Along with this main plotline, there are other problems and situations, like how Uncle Fester (Nick Kroll) is showing strange symptoms or how Grandma (Bette Midler) is throwing a party when she's supposed to be taking care of the house while the Addams are on vacation.There are so many wonderful aspects that make The Addams Family 2 a must-see. The story is well-written with a conflict for each character and many strong subplots. The only slight weak point is that the story is a bit slow in starting. However, once the rising action begins, the film flies by in a flurry of adventure and humor. The funniness of this film is truly incredible. It is an action-based film, but still incorporates so much humor into every part. The locations are very accurate, despite being animated. For people who have visited some of these places, it is so cool to be able to see an animated representation of them. Some of the places include Niagara Falls, Miami beaches, Death Valley, Texas deserts and the Grand Canyon. Besides the strong story and fun locations, the family-based conflicts are so relatable for real families. Everyday things such as siblings arguing, parent-child relationships, struggles to belong and not feeling like yourself are common within the Addams family. Wednesday and Pugsley Addams (Javon Walton) are constantly fighting; Gomez Addams feels as if he falls short in including Wednesday in things and Morticia Addams (Charlize Theron) tries her best to comfort everyone. The animation for all of the characters is outstanding. The voice acting is one of the more positive aspects of the film; all the actors sound exactly like their character and we can imagine what the character is feeling or thinking. Bill Hader, as Cyrus, makes a wonderfully mysterious character. Chloe Grace Moretz's Wednesday is a seemingly cold character who opens up as the film progresses; her voice acting really is superb.The theme of The Addams Family 2 is to be yourself and to not force someone to be who they're not. It also emphasizes being careful about who you trust with important things. There are some very mild insulting comments and, of course, some creepy science scenes.The Addams Family 2 gets 4.5 out of 5 stars from me and I recommend it for ages 6 to 18 plus adults. Addams Family 2 releases in theaters October 1, 2021, so check it out! By Kyla C., KIDS FIRST!",positive
"The Addams Family 2Some mean reviews on here and not sure why!I really enjoyed this movie, it got of to a slow start establishing the story, however 30 mins in it moved up a gear.The movie reached its very best when Lurch sang ""I will survive"" with a biker gang, truly inspired.This was all round family fun, I'm giving this a hard 7 outta 10, meaning you won't be disappointed.",positive
"I didn't know that much about the plot except that it was about them going on a family road trip, after watching it I got more then I expected.I still like the The Addams and the voice actors playing them, I found it pretty funny and the animation was nice looking and pretty.The villain wasn't anything that big but the 3rd act was really weird and strange, I enjoyed this a bit more than the first but I still liked both of them.I won't give away anything, but if you get a chance I suggest giving it a watch.",positive

"2021 PG director: Greg Tiernan, Conrad Vernon.Starring: Charleze Theron, Oscar Isaac, Chloe Grace Moretz, Bill Hader, Javon Walton, Nick Kroll, Snoop Dogg, Bette Midler, Wallace Shawn etcEveryone's favourite spooky family is back in the animated comedy sequel, The Addams Family 2. In this all-new movie, we find Morticia and Gomez distraught that their children are growing up, skipping family dinners, and totally consumed with ""scream time."" To reclaim their bond, they decide to cram Wednesday, Pugsley, Uncle Fester, and the crew into their haunted camper and hit the road for one last miserable family vacation. Their adventure across America takes them out of their element and into hilarious run-ins with their iconic cousin, It, as well as many new kooky characters. What could possibly go wrong? For me this was a pleasant surprise!My first few positives would be the great animation and humour. As well as the fun strange tone, great family dynamic and voice cast. With a great soundtrack. This film's animation was very impressive. It expanded the universe, and it went bolder and brighter. And was really a visual treat for the eyes embracing the weirdness of the world. I also thought the humour was stronger along with the strange tone this time around. This film really dialled up the strange interactions between the family and how they communicate with each other, I felt like they played it safe the first time around but this time they embraced the kooky and dark nature of the characters, with some clever and funny jokes that will go over a lot of children's heads. What helped with the humour was the more focused family dynamic. Each character got their opportunity to shine whilst also having the conflict and themes around the family as the focus. I also thought the voice cast was amazing as always. They bought the characters to life excellently, with charismatic and fun voice performances that gave so much life to the characters. And the soundtrack was delightfully spooky and fun and added a lot of entertainment value to particular scenes. With the iconic Addams family theme always being a bonus.However, the film was far from perfect and still flawed. My few negatives for the film would be the underdeveloped and rushed set up. The lazy and unneeded plot points. As well as the generic elements and lapses in the logic with some characters. I thought that the film didn't lay enough groundwork for the setup, due to the frantic pacing. They didn't really reintroduce us as the audience to the characters again or with clear villains or reasoning behind their travels beyond the one dimensional. I also felt like the film had some lazy and unneeded plot points. The film did sometimes feel very incoherent and messy and was stuffing as much as they could in such short amount of time, it was hard to keep up. And certain elements added to characters such as Pugsley felt forced and didn't really hold much of a purpose to the plot. I also felt like the film did fall into a lot more genre tropes then the first instalment. Especially with the jokes aimed at pop culture that felt jarring and often out of place. And the film did fall into more of a safe and generic animation which impacted my score for it. Finally, there was some lapses in the logic where it was obvious something was wrong with Uncle Fester and the movie made the characters seem dumb, and the film didn't link the plot point or really include it until later on so it felt messy.My final few positives would be the fun scenes and development to the plot. As well as the more focused conflict with the family and the good development between them. Whilst also having great pacing and villain plus strong themes. The film had a lot of fun scenes that allowed the characters to shine in their delightful strangeness, playing around with their powers and added to the films more focused tone. I also thought the plot development was strong, the film did a good job at balancing the fun scenes establishing the family dynamic and adding more layers to the plot with the villain and connecting them as the film transitioned into the final act. I also appreciated that the film had more focused conflict between the family and stronger themes. The first film felt unfocused with its themes and the specific conflict. But this time they chose a specific character aka Wednesday and built the conflict around her character, focusing on parenting and feeling out of place within the family. For me it was a more clear and better developed source of conflict for the family, and it worked a lot better, raising some heart-warming themes on family and acceptance. Finally, I thought the pacing and the villain was strong. The film didn't overstay its welcome, moving at a fast pace whilst still including a good amount of plot, I was consistently entertained and there was never a dull moment. I also think the villain was a lot stronger this time around. His reasoning and connection with Wednesday was fascinating, and he was a lot more campy and over the top which fitted much better with the characters and the tone of the film then the villain in the first film.Overall, Addams family 2 still suffers from some weak writing and being slightly too chaotic. But this for me was an improvement over the first film. It felt more focused and embraced the strangeness of the characters and it just worker better for me. This is a great Halloween film for the family and I had a good time with it.Overall score 77/100.",positive
"The Addams Family on an Adventure is the sequel to The Addams Family from 2019. This sequel is directed by Greg Tiemand and Conrad Vernon, who also directed the first film together.In the film, the Addams family goes on vacation to improve their family ties. During their adventures, they lack many things that put their family bond to the test.This sequel feels a bit rushed and seems to copy many elements from the first part and further uses elements from the third Hotel Transylvania movie. For young viewers, some elements such as the feeling of being an outsider may not really appeal to them yet, because they are still too young for this. Because the film jumps from place to place with a new storyline at every new place, younger viewers can lose their concentration.The comedy is largely intended for younger viewers, because most comedy moves quickly and is not really developed. For mature viewers, there are a few moments of laughter in it, but they aren't that strong. Most humor consists of simple jokes, which can be easily predictable for older viewers.The animation looks appropriate, but otherwise it doesn't come across as special in the film. This is the same with the voice acting of the movie cast. Most characters are voiced again by the same actors, but because of the simple script they don't really get the chance to do anything special with their roles.",negative
"I must admit I didn't hold out high hopes for this film and sadly this proved right. I didn't find it that good as an adult and I doubt children would find it much better.There were some funny moments in it, which saved it a bit, and the film did rattler through at a reasonable pace. Overall though it was disappointing.",negative
"Family night out. I asked my kids how was the movie. They didn't like it.... The storyline wasn't that interesting. They didn't laugh at any of the humor. Nowadays, so many animation movies, they have to have a good script to get kids attention.",negative

"No Time to Die is a co-production between the United States of America and the United Kingdom from 2021 and this is of course the most recent James Bond film we have here. It is a definite contender for most awaited film of the decade because on the one hand the viewer numbers are self-explanatory and on the other hand this film has been delayed so many times because of the corona pandemic that it was truly high time for it to actually hit theaters everywhere. Which it did not too long ago. Being a a huge Bond fan myself, who has seen all the other films (no exceptions), I was curious enough to watch several hours of red-carpet broadcast from London a while ago when the film had its world premiere there and most key cast members showed up and the Royals were also there to check it out. It runs for over 2 hours and 40 minutes which makes it a truly long film and even if it is an hour or so longer than another Daniel Craig Bond movie, nobody can really be surprised. It was already an option that Craig could end his Bond career before this one here, but he returned again for a fifth and final 007 performance. Unfortunately, as you can see from the title of my review, I don't think this was as amazing as it could have been. I still think that Casino Royale and Skyfall are his two best movies and clearly ahead of the rest, even if it's not easy at all to pick the number one. But that is another story. Let's look at this one here now. Director is Cary Joji Fukunaga, who is mostly known for his work on True Detective, so the outcome here is surely his biggest big screen success as of now. He is also one of the writers and the other two are again Purvis and Wade who were already there during the Brosnan era. Enough said. They could very well also be there again when the next 007 takes over. Whoever it will be. I mean we already have a Black female 007 in this film, even if I doubt she will become the new lead to the franchise. But we will see.As for the cast, there is nothing to say about Craig anymore. Some of the others are people who reprise their characters from previous movies. Especially the one before. Léa Seydoux is back playing Bond's one and only love interest in this film and it's very serious as we find out, not only because of the child that joins them, but also because of the long sequence early on, which is linked to Vesper Lynd again and her story of betrayal back in Craig's very first Bond movie, so it is a bit of a framework you could say. Is he betrayed again? This time by Madeleine? Christoph Waltz is in this film here too. No surprise obviously, but he does not have a lot of screen time unfortunately. He is an actor I like and I definitely think that there could have been much more to his Blofeld than there was in this film and the previous one. Let's be honest: With what they did with/to him here, it maybe would have been better if he had not been in the film at all. I think Fukunaga was basically only looking for a way to get him out of the picture somehow and put all his focus on the key antagonist in here. That would be the character played by Oscar winner Rami Malek. He is a new addition to the cast and (if we don't count the very first masked scene) it takes quite a while for him to finally join the action, namely when he sits there in Madeleine's presence, but once he is there, he is bound to stay. Great screen presence as always and his villain character is among the better aspects from this film, especially in that scene where he takes the girl from her with the aura of poison all around him. Another antagonist character is played by Dali Benssalah. Very easy to identify too with his physicality. Not just the eye, even if this eye, especially in the final fight scene, and how he/it is taken out is maybe the biggest cult moment from this film and I had to think of Oddjob's hat back in Goldfinger there. I could go on and on. Jeffrey Wright is there again, so is Ralph Fiennes. Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris. New faces with a decent amount of screen time include Lashana Lynch, David Dencik and Billy Magnussen. All no really big names, so they made sure nobody takes away too much attention from Craig's farewell performance.Comedy is once again nothing you find too frequently in here. There was some banter here and there between Bond and the new 007 about who is allowed to carry this number. There was this eye scene linked to the gadget, the one I just mentioned. Oh and maybe for my comedic highlight of it all I must mention Ben Whishaw. His talk about the guest he was about to have was more of a politically correct failure piece of comedy, maybe also linked to the actor's own sexuality, but when he tried to pretend in front of M that he had not seen Bond before this encounter, it was pretty funny. I give them/him that. Big smile there. As for the more dramatic moments, of course the one that stands out the very most is the exact ending. Bond has never died before in these films, so they were taking completely new directions here. I am not sure if I like it though. Big challenge and they probably could not have depicted it any better, but Bond always had this unkillable aura and maybe they should have stayed with it. Like breaking an unwritten rule. Oh well, this was not the first time Blofeld died either and they killed Leiter in the process of it too, but they will all be back sooner or later. In any case, these rockets hitting the island were pretty spectacular. Also bittersweet that they came from his side and 007 ordered them to be fired and you could say that M or MI6 messed up themselves by the fact that they lost this Heracles, this priceless killing program, to the bad side. So his own folks' shortcomings result in Bond's death in this movie. But he still makes sure that evil is buried with him and this gigantic factory of villainy goes down as well. The island between Russia and Asia here I liked the way it was depicted. The isolation of it all, but also these water areas (or liquid areas) in which people were working in thick riot gears. Not sure this is the right word.As for the Bond song by Billie Eilish, I remember not liking it too much when I heard it first. Then it grew a bit on me over the months in the process of looking forward to this film perhaps. Now, as I heard it connected to the movie, I again am not too big on it. Also felt to me as if it was not used on many other occasions except the opening sequence where they always use the Bond song. So yeah, this will surely be one of the more forgettable Bond song and I am pretty sure that it will not repeat the awards success that Adele and Sam Smith had with their previous Bond songs. But we will see. An Oscar nomination seems like a big success already from my perspective. The win is not an option as of now the way I see it. I should probably also mention Finneas as he is co-writer, but I just don't really understand the Eilish hype at all. The music that stands out way more here is certainly Louis Armstrong's ""We Have All the Time in the World"", a timeless classic that you will hear with the closing credits and you also hear the name of this song being referenced on several occasions during this movie, key occasions really. The timelessness of this piece is something Eilish and her brother can only dream of. And it's also a beautiful jump back in time because this was used back in the day during the early 007 movie days already. For Dr. No if I am not mistaken. So yeah, the film had something to offer on the music front as well, not only with Hans Zimmer's soundtrack. The technicality we don't need to criticize. Costumes, sets, makeup, cinematography, sound effects etc. All this is in competent hands here and could not have been much better. But story is key and this is the reason why I don't give a truly high rating. By the way, I thought on some occasion that Madeleine's father here could be Blofeld. I mean we hear about him being a killer, a doctor which he is in the old film, always carries the title Dr. Ernst Stavro Blofeld and here in the previous film he even went with Mr. Bleuchamp, so a French connection was also there. So when we know that Bond can kill Blofeld with his hands because of the virus, I thought that he would kill Madeleine too, but they touched and kissed and she did not die, so we did not find out about her real father.As for Malek's character, he is of course also a tragic figure with what happened to his family early on and his revenge idea in terms of killing the killer's family can be related to somehow, but what he turns into is definitely insane. I mean this was a touch of Thanos already I felt. Killing millions of people and causing some kind of natural selection this way. While with Thanos we were getting this idea of a relentless god, I still felt that they could have elaborated a bit more there on Safin's approach. Not the tennis player. Sorry, I just had to. Overall, this is of course unsurprisingly another Bond film that people who like the franchise should not miss out on and it is also definitely a better watch in movie theaters. Go see it on the big screen and preferrably do so now while it is still on because I have made the experience that at least here they do not really show past Bond films in movie theaters anymore. The old ones. Maybe because they are all on television still from time to time and actually several times each year. I am not sure what you will like most about this movie, but I think there is enough to pick from and there are definitely more positive moments to the outcome here than negative moments. Actually, almost no negative moments. Ana de Armas could have been given better material. I mean she is second-cast on imdb because of her name, but barely a factor. Oh well, maybe we will see more from her character in the next movie. It's still also never really a great film unfortunately. I feel like Fukunaga was playing it safe overall, which hurt the film.",negative
"Bond is back at last. Daniel Craig is the longest serving Bond with the fewest films.Once again Bond is out of the service, bumming around the Caribbean.It's Felix Leiter who coaxes him back to action. Only to find that M has replaced him with a new 007.The target is a biological weapon that horns in on DNA. The British were developing it but lost it to Spectre, or so they thought.For Bond it's a reunion with Blofeld and Madeleine, a woman he thought he loved but let go, mistakenly. She never did have time to tell him her secret.However there is a new foe called Safin and he is bearing a grudge but it is against Spectre.The movie is long and lacks a spectacular action sequence. It also feels a lot like a Christopher Nolan film. Just check out all those black Range Rovers, the booming bass and the car action scenes.I also thought Safin himself was a weak baddie. I could understand his hatred for Blofeld but not against the world or Bond.The stirrings of a Louis Armstrong song at the beginning gives the impression that the movie will contain several farewells.For Bond there are also a few new character developments. He crosses swords with M. He has regrets and might need to make the ultimate sacrifice.The ending is rather faithful to the novel of You Only Live Twice.One big issue I have and this is something the producers need to consider in the future. The film has three villains with facial disfigurements.",negative
"It takes 30 minutes to get to the opening credits. We discover Bond has a love in Madeleine (Léa Seydoux) and we discover she is the daughter of Spectre. After a near death experience Bond places her on a train and goes and lives on an island somewhere. He is drawn back into service with the re-emergence of the Heracles project which targets DNA and uses nanobots. Oh yeah. There is a remote island with a sinister lab on it.I am weary of the whole Spectre fight. The new personal aspects of Bond bored me. Daniel Craig is classless compared to Sean Connery and gets his hands way too dirty. The opening theme was lousy. It was certainly no ""Diamonds are Forever."" And the ending? Geesh. You thought fans were upset when Judi Dench was axed. I did like Ana de Armas as Paloma for the short time she was on the screen. Why didn't they write her a larger role? She would have been great during the end scenes.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",negative
"When I first watched Daniel Craig 15 years ago, I was not ready for the direction they were taking the character. It felt like a good movie, but it felt quite divorced from the Bond I grew up with ... the Bond I knew. But apart from that effort being a Bond begins sort of thing (and this being the other end of that ... line), the franchise bit by bit gave us certain things ... we as viewers yearned for. While keeping it fresh.Bond ... James Bond! That line - one of many that are (in)famous in the long list of Bond movies - gets a new spin here. As is the iconic Bond shooting towards the camera. Now I could name many more things that this film revisits and I probably still would miss some. There are many references here, either visually or via audio.The beginning is quite the introduction ... it is almost funny because it takes its time. And it is funny because the rest sometimes feels rushed. There are many loose ends the movie wants to (neatly?) tie up. Another day, another Bond song, another Bond intro - although quite late in the game.Bond has grown - grown not just over the course of the movie Craig played him, but generally speaking. Society changes and Bond has no issue sitting on on the backseat of a motorbike, while a woman is driving. That is not enough for you to go on a rampage and scream ""wokeness"".Many known faces return, but many new ones too. Be it the ever excellent if only shortly used Ana de Armas (no pun intended) or our uber villain Rami Malek. Now while I really liked what I saw and while the running time is 2,5 hours ... there are things that can be seen and called flaws. You can question Bonds love to Eva Greens character ... or him still holding onto her, you can question methods used and how convenient certain things happen - or how some stunts would put the Fast and Furious franchise to shame ... but if you did that, you would derive yourself of a lot of fun.Not being aware of the previous entries may not be necessary, but you'll have a lot of things to discover and smile at, if you have seen at least some of them. Of course if it is only a few of them, make it the Craig Bonds, so you have the whole ... story. Generally speaking I can't wait to revisit all the movies.No time to watch (them)? Well make time ;) Also to conclude with a fun ""fact"": the title No time to Die has been used before ... by another movie in 2006. The year Daniel Craig became Bond! Coincidence? Or full circle? All kidding aside, I have not seen that movie (yet), so don't hate on me if it isn't any good. Otherwise, out with the old ... in with the new - whoever that may be and however the franchise is going to reinvent itself ... I'll be there - I hope you will be there too.",positive
"It felt as though we were never going to get to see this, but finally it's here, the question is, was it worth the wait?The answer, yes, really not what I was expecting, of course it's action packed, dramatic and high octane, but it actually boasts a good story, and perhaps shows us a slightly different side to the character.I thought Daniel Craig was awesome, and I'm sad that he's leaving, it's fascinating now to know who'll take over.On the downside, it was long, it was way too long, it did lull a little in parts, but the action was enough to halt any dozing.Overall, very watchable, 8/10.",positive
"The twenty-fifth Bond movie, reported as the last for the leading actor, was first delayed by the departure of original director Danny Boyle, due to creative differences, and then three or four times by the impact of COVID-19, with the lockdowns and restrictions. It became probably the most highly anticipated film in the franchise's history and was predicted to be the biggest film to bring audiences back to the cinemas. Finally, after almost two years of delays and waiting, it was released; I am a huge fan of Bond and I was super excited to see it on the big screen, co-written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge (Fleabag), directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga (Jane Eyre, Beasts of No Nation). Basically, in the opening flashback, Lyutsifer Safin (Rami Malek) visits the house of Mr. White, intending to kill him. He is not there, but his wife (Mathilde Bourbin) and daughter, young Madeleine Swann (Coline Defaud), are inside. While Safin kills White's wife, Madeline shoots him and flees, but Safin survives. He chases Madeline onto a nearby frozen lake, and she falls through the ice, but Safin rescues her. In the present, Madeleine (Léa Seydoux) is with James Bond (Daniel Craig) in Matera, following the capture of Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Christoph Waltz) and Bond's resignation. While he is there, Bond visits the tomb of his former lover Vesper Lynd, but he is ambushed by assassins from the Spectre organisation. The assassins, led by mercenary Primo aka ""Cyclops"" (Dali Benssalah), who has a cybernetic eye, chase Bond and Madeleine in Bond's gadget ladened Aston Martin DB5. Although they manage to overpower and evade the assassins, Bond believes Madeleine has betrayed him, despite her pleas, and leaves her. Five years later, MI6 scientist Valdo Obruchev (David Dencik) is kidnapped from a secret MI6 laboratory. With the approval of M (Ralph Fiennes), Obruchev had developed Project Heracles, a bioweapon containing nanobots that infect like a virus upon touch and are coded to an individual's DNA, rendering it lethal to the target and their relatives but harmless to others. Bond has retired to Jamaica, where he is contacted by his friend, CIA agent Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright), and his colleague Logan Ash (Billy Magnussen). Leiter asks for Bond's help in finding Obruchev, which he declines. But then he meets Nomi (Lashana Lynch), an MI6 agent who has been a Double-O for two years, becoming his successor as 007. She tells him about Project Heracles, after which Bond agrees to help Leiter, despite Nomi's warnings not to interfere. Bond goes to Cuba and meets CIA agent Paloma (Knives Out's Ana de Armas), as they infiltrate a Spectre meeting for Blofeld's birthday where they believe Obruchev will be. Still imprisoned in Belmarsh, Blofeld uses Primo's ""bionic eye"" to lead the meeting and order his members to kill Bond with a ""nanobot mist"". But the mist instead kills all the Spectre members, as Obruchev had reprogrammed the nanobots to infect them, on orders from Safin. Bond captures Obruchev and rendezvous with Leiter and Ash on a boat. But Ash reveals himself to be double agent working for Safin, he shoots Leiter and escapes with Obruchev. With a bomb exploded and the boat sinking, Bond is forced to leave the fatally wounded Felix, but he promises, before he dies, he will finish the mission. Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) and Q (Ben Whishaw) arrange a meeting between Bond and Blofeld in prison to try to find Obruchev. Safin visits and coerces Madeleine to infect herself with a nanobot dose to kill Blofeld, as she has been his only visitor since his incarceration. Bond and Madeleine are speechless seeing each other at Blofeld's prison cell, he touches her and unknowingly infects himself before she leaves. Blofeld confesses to Bond that he staged the ambush at Vesper's tomb to appear as if Madeleine had betrayed him. Bond reacts by attacking Blofeld, unintentionally causing the nanobots to infect and kill him. Bond tracks Madeleine to her childhood home in Norway and learns she has a five-year-old daughter, Mathilde (Lisa-Dorah Sonnet), but she claims she is not his. Madeleine tells him that when Safin was a boy, his parents were murdered by her father on Blofeld's orders. Safin was the sole survivor of Mr. White's dioxin attack on his family, leaving him facially disfigured from chemical burns. Having avenged his family by killing Blofeld and destroying Spectre, Safin continues his rampage with Ash. Safin's army pursue Bond, Madeleine, and Mathilde through the woods. Though Bond kills Ash and his thugs, Safin captures Madeleine and Mathilde. Safin's headquarters is located on an island between Japan and Russia, and harbours a missile base, converted to a nanobot factory, where Obruchev is mass-producing the technology so Safin can use it to kill millions of people. Q enables Bond and Nomi to infiltrate the base. Bond kills many of Safin's men while Nomi kills Obruchev by pushing him into a nanobot vat. Madeleine escapes captivity while Safin lets Mathilde go. Nomi takes Madeleine and Mathilde away from the island while Bond stays behind to open the island's blast-resistant silo doors, calling a missile strike from submarine HMS Dragon to destroy the factory. Bond kills Safin's remaining men, including Primo using electromagnetic pulse in his wristwatch to overload and explode the cybernetic eye in his head. Safin ambushes Bond, shooting and infecting him with a vial containing nanobots programmed to kill Madeleine and Mathilde upon his touch. Despite his injuries, Bond kills Safin after a fight and opens the silo doors. Speaking by radio with Madeleine, Bond tells her he loves her and encourages her to move on without him. In his final moments, Madeleine confirms that Mathilde is his daughter as Bond says goodbye. The missiles hit the island, destroying the nanobot factory and killing Bond. At MI6, M, Moneypenny, Nomi, Q and Tanner (Rory Kinnear) drink in Bond's memory. As Madeleine takes Mathilde to Matera, she tells her about her father, James Bond. Also starring Hugh Dennis as Dr. Hardy, Priyanga Burford as Dr. Symes, and Javone Prince as MI6 Security Guard. Craig makes the most of his final outing as the world's most famous spy being determined but also emotional, Seydoux (so far only the second Bond Girl to return, after Sylvia Trench) is beautiful and memorable as his lover, Lynch is reasonable in her annoyingly underwritten part, de Armas steals her scenes as the bubbly and slightly airheaded CIA agent, Malek is a bit too hammy and not very chilling as the villain, but Waltz gets a terrific Hannibal Lecter style cameo, and there is good support from Fiennes, Wright and Whishaw. It is a good story (the virus aspect being eerily relevant with the times we have lived in), filled with only occasional need for gadgets and gimmicks. It has drama and emotion, plenty of gripping chases, fights and explosive sequences, some humour, and the Billie Eilish title song (the second Bond song to hit Number One) is okay. You will notice things from previous entries popping up, including the Aston Martin V8 Volante from The Living Daylights (people have compared Craig's more aggressive Bond as similar to Timothy Dalton), but the most noticeable is the Louis Armstrong song ""We Have All the Time in the World"", and the John Barry theme. This is a clever throwback to On Her Majesty's Secret Service, which famously ended with Bond's wife being killed. Well, spoiler alert, Bond dies in a genuinely sad way (he goes out with a bang, literally), and the song plays in the end credits. There will be fans that will be shocked and maybe angry at producers breaking the golden rule (Bond must never die!), but Casino Royale started with Bond earning his Double-O status, and this is a brave, poignant, and (I think) suitable conclusion to Craig's tenure. It may be two hours and three quarters long, but it didn't feel like, the time is taken up well and this is just the kind of entertainment you need, and don't worry, ""James Bond Will Return"", a terrific spy action adventure. Very good!",positive
The story is really engaging. It didn't feel like 2.5 hours! I enjoyed every second of it. I like the bond between Daniel Craig and Lea Seydoux. The ending got me tearful. Who would have thought James Bond would make someone cry?,positive
"Of course the James Bond spirit is not exactly the same as the other films over decades. It is more gloomy, darker, with a total different face of our hero. You have in this movie many unexpected things, but the overall scheme remains à James Bond movie, maybe more than SKYFALL, which was far far more a crime thriller than an OO7 feature. Watch it again and compare. In a way, SKYFALL announced this one, with SPECTRE in the middle. Not the best Bond ever, but not the worst either.",negative
"I saw this with a friend who watched the original ""Dr. No"" (1962) at the time, and who proclaimed at the end of this 2¾ hour marathon that this just isn't ""James Bond"". My first ""Bond"" film was some fifteen years later but i was forced to agree with him. This isn't. I have never been the biggest fan of Daniel Craig - he completely lacks charisma on screen. There is no glint in his eye! Add to that the grim determination of the producers to rob the character of his flaws and foibles; to politically correct every aspect of the storylines and to generally sterilise what was always, essentially, a charming tale of light weight male chauvinism with espionage, shameless patriotism, gadgets, double entendre and a damn good theme tune. Here, Craig has precious little chemistry with either of his female co-stars and the baddie features so sparingly (though that maybe because he was double-jobbing for Lord Lloyd Webber at the Opera) that even by the end there just wasn't a sense of accumulated tension, peril or danger - indeed I just felt really quite underwhelmed. Of course, it is a fabulous looking film: the old Aston Martin makes a welcome return - as does the divine Louis Armstrong's ""All the Time in the World"" but I wonder how many of us will recall this film once the dust has settled. It has a role right now; it may well single-handedly rescue cinema from the horrible effects of lockdown, and for that is must be congratulated, but speaking as a lifelong Bond fan, I'd implore those at the helm of the next one: can we please get back to what Bond is entertaining at, what Ian Fleming designed him to be and stop imposing wafer-thin stories on equally thin, undercooked, characterisations and hope that nostalgia and John Barry et al will dupe us into thinking it is great? I don't care if the next 007 is gay/girl/coloured/one legged - but please can we get back to a story laced with humour and personality with a script that allows for nuance, sarcasm and charm. Otherwise, perhaps Bond has just served his purpose, it's time to move on? Sorry - I was really disappointed.",negative
"Daniel Craig delivers a robust farewell performance as 007 in the 25th James Bond movie ""No Time to Die,"" another long, drawn-out, often tedious extravaganza with lackluster villains capped off with a bizarre ending. Mind you, the 007 gang is all back, including Ms. Moneypenny (Naomie Harris), gadget guru Q (Ben Whishaw), Chief of Staff Tanner (Rory Kinnear), CIA agent Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright), and 007's crusty boss M (Ralph Fiennes) Head of MI6. Bond's perpetual enemy Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Oscar winner Christoph Waltz of ""Inglourious Basterds"") lurks on the periphery from his prison cell. Sadly, although he reappears here, Blofeld's screen time is far too minimal. Rami Malik's somnambulist villain Lyutsifer Safin epitomizes every Ian Fleming literary character who ever sought revenge. Worse, Safin's lack of stature in the gallery of audacious Bond adversaries doesn't serve him well. Meantime, too much of anything can be a bore, and Bond 25's biggest shortcoming is its length. Clocking in at a marathon 163 minutes, this 007 outing makes repeated allusions to ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" (1969). The least the Bond producers could have done is whittle 45 minutes off this meandering melodrama. Meanwhile, not only does Q have more than his usual number of scenes, but so also does M. Actually, M sets everything in motion with a cloak-and-dagger project codenamed Heracles that he conjured up without approval. Mind you, the $250 million budget makes ""No Time to Die"" look like a travelogue, with the scenic locales overshadowing the larger-than-life shenanigans. Indeed, ""No Time to Die"" boasts impressive production values, with Craig eager to engage his enemies with or without his license to kill. Unfortunately, little about ""Beast of No Nation"" director Cary Joji Fukunaga's entry in the cinematic Ian Fleming franchise is remarkable, except its ending. Ultimately, despite everything you may have heard to the contrary, the closing credits to ""No Time to Die"" conclude with the familiar phrase: JAMES BOND WILL RETURN. Compared with Craig's other Bond movies, ""No Time to Die"" makes Craig's most abysmal outing ""Quantum of Solace"" appear superior on several counts.""No Time to Die"" unfolds in the past, with Madeleine Swann as a child (newcomer Coline Defaud), living with her mother (Mathilde Bourbin of ""Louise""), in a remote but picturesque domicile in the middle of a snow-swept, Norwegian forest on the edge of a frozen lake. Madeleine's mom is Mr. White's wife. Earlier, the notorious Mr. White appeared in both ""Casino Royale"" (2006) and ""Quantum of Solace"" (2008) as an enemy agent who tangled with Bond. This opening scene occurs long before either of those Bond escapades. An enigmatic stranger garbed in military apparel, wearing a Japanese Noh mask, and armed with an assault rifle, arrives at Mr. White's house. Lyutsifer Safin (Rami Malik) has come to kill Mr. White because he murdered Safin's parents and family. Seeking payback, Safin has to settle for killing White's wife, since White isn't home. Madeleine manages to shoot Safin, but she doesn't kill him. Instead, fleeing from the house, she crosses onto the frozen lake, plunges through thin ice, and almost drowns. Ironically, Safin rescues Madeleine. Afterward, ""No Time to Die"" fast-forwards into the future. We learn James Bond has not only retired from MI6, but he has also fallen in love with an adult Madeleine. If you missed the previous Bond ""Spectre"" (2015), you should watch it. Meantime, the couple are vacationing in sunny Italy near the cemetery where Bond's long, lost ""Casino Royale"" lover Vesper Lynd is buried. Sentimental sap that Bond is, he visits her grave. Moments before the gravesite blows up in his face, Bond spots a business card with Spectre's symbol--an octopus--embossed on it. Naturally, Bond thinks Madeleine wanted to kill him. She didn't, but he doesn't learn this until five years later. More Spectre assassins emerge to kill our hero, but he survives their futile attempts on his life.Meanwhile, terrorists break into a secret MI6 laboratory and kidnap a scientist, Valdo Obruchev (David Dencik of ""The Snowman""), who has been developing Project Herakles, a deadly, top-secret, DNA-based bioweapon teeming with nanobots that can infect a person like a virus. Worst, Herakles was M's brainchild, and it was supposed to enable an assassin to kill a target in a crowd without harming anybody else. Eventually, Madeleine and Bond reunite when MI6 dispatches Bond to a maximum-security British prison where Blofeld is held. Madeleine (Léa Seydoux of ""The Lobster"") is Blofeld's psychiatrist. Blofeld confesses to Bond that he--not Madeleine--tried to kill him in Italy. Anything more about this elaborate plot would either be confusing or spoil the impending revelations. Like a standard issue Bond opus, our hero tracks down Obruchev and finds him on Safin's private island where the villain cultivates poisonous plants in an exotic garden. Mind you, this garden is something the writers took from Ian Fleming's second-to-last Bond novel ""You Only Live Twice.""Apart from two impressive, bullet-riddled, stunt-laden, action scenes featured in the ""No Time to Die"" trailer, nothing here will spike your blood pressure. Typically, the flamboyant villains make Bond movies memorable. Alas, Blofeld has only a couple of scenes, while Safin doesn't pose much of a physical threat. Daniel Craig and Léa Seydoux generate only a modicum of chemistry as lovers. The other letdown is MI6 agent Nomi (Lashana Lynch of ""Captain Marvel""), who has inherited Bond's number 007. She adds little to the fireworks that spotlight her mettle. Altogether, ""No Time To Die"" qualifies as a fair-to-middling thriller.",negative

Craig's swan song as 007 delivers all the goods with his brute force tactics and surprising vulnerability are on tap when his services are requested after 5 years retirement to stop baddie Lyutsifer Safin (silky Malek) from infiltrating a deadly nanobot virus via DNA into the world populace while also nursing his love for Seydoux who is in the mix in oh so many ways. Filmmaker Cary Joji Fukunaga (who collaborated on the screenplay with Nal Purvis, Robert Wade and Phoebe Waller-Bridge) infuses death-defying set pieces with visual flair to spare (best viewed in Imax) as well as some much needed dry wit and humor.",positive
"The first 20-25 minutes are superb (from the music to the location to the acting to the action), but then the titles fall (cool titles, bland song), and the movie never quite reaches those heights again. For such a long, bloated running time it's too talky and surprisingly short on action; in fact, there are only two other notable set-pieces, the car chase in the woods and Ana de Armas brightening up the screen as an overeager, bubbly yet skilled and deadly agent. Most of the rest of the action is uninspired, and in the climactic sequence (just a regular attack-on-the-enemy-fortress we've seen hundreds of times) often dim and murky (Tomorrow Never Dies did this sort of thing much better, and so did some of the Roger Moore Bonds). The plot is formulaic (biological weapon....again), and its treatment of several key players from previous installments disappointing. The ending is pretty silly - it leaves a mess behind that the (inevitable) next chapter will either have to work a whale of a story to get around or (more likely) will ignore altogether. Craig does succeed at embodying a very human Bond, yet I can't help but think that he never really got the chance to do a FUN James Bond living the high life: in Casino he is earning his stripes, in Quantum he is seeking vengeance, in Skyfall he is already tired and resigned, in No Time his circle comes to an end. I guess he came closest to having a good time in Spectre, which is why that film is still my favorite of the five he made. **1/2 out of 4.",negative
"Greetings again from the darkness. Bond 25 is here, and it's quite a curtain call for actor Daniel Craig. The film's release has been postponed numerous times since September 2019, which has caused expectations and anxiety to build amongst Bond fans. It's been almost six years since SPECTRE (2015), and this is Daniel Craig's fifth and final turn as 007. This production faced challenges even before the pandemic hit. Cary Joji Fukunaga (best known for ""True Detective"" and BEASTS OF NO NATION, 2015) was hired to direct after Danny Boyle stepped down (or whatever happened), and Phoebe Waller-Bridge was brought in to spice up the dialogue on the script from Fukunaga, Neal Purvis, and Robert Wade (the latter two having been involved in writing all five Bond movies for Craig). Of course, it's Ian Fleming to whom we stand eternally grateful for the original characters.For those accustomed to the James Bond cinematic formula, you'll notice quite a few differences - beginning with the opening scenes. Traditionally, breathtaking action kicks off the film; but this time a shift in tone and style serves up a tension-filled opening that occurs five years prior to the rest of the story. It takes a few minutes before we get the first true action sequence. Of course, we must keep in mind that we are dealing with a ""retired"" James Bond (don't worry, it's not like ""fat Thor"") ... in fact, there's already a replacement 007 and she (Lashana Lynch, CAPTAIN MARVEL, 2019) packs quite an attitude and skill set.It's his old CIA buddy, Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright), who draws Bond back into the espionage game, and of course, the reason is to save the world (what else could it be?). This year's world-domination-seeking villain is the cleverly named Lyutsifer Safin, and he's played by Oscar winner Rami Malek (BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY, 2018). Safin is a low-key baddie whose weapon is a DNA-altering chemical that's probably a bit overly complex for a Bond movie, and it's also a bit strange that Safin/Malek only has a few substantive scenes. For those who saw SPECTRE, you'll recognize many of the faces, including Lea Seydoux as Madeleine Swann, Ralph Fiennes as M, Ben Whishaw as Q, Rory Kinnear as Tanner, and Naomie Harris as Moneypenny. Also back for a terrific scene is Oscar winner Christoph Waltz as Blofield. The new faces include the aforementioned Lashana Lynch as Nomi, Billy Magnusson as Logan Ash, and Craig's KNIVES OUT co-star Ana de Armas as Paloma. Ms. De Armas brings a jolt of energy and some smiles to the proceedings, and it's a shame her appearance is so short.It's unusual for a Bond song to win its Grammy before the movie is ever released, but that's exactly what happened for Billie Eilish's achingly somber title song. Oscar winner Hans Zimmer (THE LION KIING) delivers a wonderful score in his first Bond outing (you'll hear how he incorporates the Eilish song), and the cinematography from Oscar winner Linus Sandgren (LA LA LAND) is everything we could hope for in the action sequences (there is no shortage of bombs), as well as the quiet moments.Speaking of the quiet moments, this is undoubtedly the most sentimental and emotional of all Bond films. Sure, we get the amazing set pieces, the crazy stunts, the awesome Aston Martin (until it isn't), the cool gadgets, the wisecracks, and the shootouts - but we also get Bond at his most reflective and personal. There is a line in the film, ""Letting go is hard."" And it is ... both for Bond and for us. So welcome back and adieu, Mr. Bond. Craig. Daniel Craig.The film opens in U. S. theaters on October 8, 2021.",positive
"No time to die well is a must watch for Bond fans. I believe No Time to die may put to rest a much tired movie series. The first third starts out with a mystery. Why is the guy there and who is that young gal? Bond has a life of leisure with a true love, but in true Bond fashion Bond is who Bond can not live in peace. There is a memorable bad guy with one eye etc and a conflict with a mysterious girlfriend. 10 out of ten . The middle gets bogged down with the usual government loses something story line. Bond which is a non p c series has some woke characters, the over tough gal, and whippy guy flat characters which drags the story but thankfully the characters become more believable later on. The cool gadgets are back in the middle. The bad guy is interesting, but the story has predictable video game style action. Middle is 5 stars. The bottom third has the usual, eye roll, Bond count down, and Bond saves the world. Bond has a family, which does not mix with Bond's living on the edge lifestyle. Some of the Bond action is video game ish, which is bit much. The story all folds together with an interesting sub plots and a surprise ending. I give the ending a 7. Not the best ending, but a must see for Bond fans. Well directed and acted. 7 stars.",positive
"Much has been made about No Time To Die bringing the Daniel Craig era to completion, so I'll skip past this. No, this is a perfect dose of escapism; intense, emotional and brimming with action. It picks up the best hanging threads from Casino Royale and Skyfall, throws in some callbacks to classic Bond movies and allows Craig to leave an immense mark on this franchise. I'm thankful that he didn't walk away after Spectre, and really delivered something to savor here. Given the runtime, this could've been a last gasp - but far from it. This is a joyride well worth taking.... And lest I forget, the most brilliant use of an f-bomb I've heard in a very long time. Ralph Fiennes is a treasure.",positive
"Because of a World Wide Pandemic which in some quarters has motives like the ruin the world, James Bond is back again trying to save the world. In order to do so he must deal with the old criminal organization Spectre and Blowfeld who has been the bad guys for many years it seems. The difference here is that they are really red herrings being used by a mad man who wants to kill a majority of the world's population using a high technology bug that is programmed to kill people by their DNA.For the long time Bond fan, the biggest hint about the movie is before the opening credits. There is a long sequence where Bond tells the lovely woman he is with they have ""all the time in the world"". The theme from his Majesty's Secret Service runs through the film. It's closing credits even feature a great stereo remastering of Louis Armstrong doing the original theme from the George L (Bond) only film of the late 1960's.One strange thing in the world of Bond. Years ago Blowfeld was totally bald. This many years later he has hair. Perhaps he saw those Bosley ads for getting rid of baldness in the years after. Lea Seydoux the second French actress to be a Bond Woman in the series and Madeline for the second straight film after Spectre is indeed a tough Bond woman with a gun. Ralph Fiennes continues his role from Spectre (2015) as M. Naomi Harris is in her second straight as Moneypenny though. She played Eve in Skyfall so this is her third straight Bond and along with Maude Adams has played 2 women characters in the series. This generations regulars are all here along with a portrait of one tough special Judi Dench portrait that appears in a hallway late in the film.While the film keeps all the Fleming characters and the usual save the world plot, it is done freshly enough for even viewers not born yet when the series began to enjoy the action and the acting. Since Daniel Craig has been Bond the acting has gained more importance and balance with the action. It has been a welcome change. Each man who played Bond had different ways to do it and there were times that action and special effects took priority over acting. That has changed and is one of the strengths of this one.While the film feels like nonstop action, there is some acting here too. The ending might come as a shock to long time Bond fans, but considering this series it is something which was done in more than 1 of the Bond Films in the beginning, only this time it appears to be done for good. Spoiler- the film also discloses that Bond and Madeline have a daughter now. This is the first actual recorded sibling of Bond though there were enough scenes over the years in Bond films to suggest an episode of Maury Povich doing DNA tests on some of the other ladies he had recreation with. Finally though, yes James, you are the father.Scenery is still a big part of this and many filming locations were used in this one. This tradition has always been a part of the series. At the end it does say ""Bond will return"", but the feeling here is that the form of his return will be as a her. The set up very much looks that way. The Bond women are getting nicer curves, but that is nothing unusual. It is a concession to the times, and is welcome too. Women built thin like guys are not in style as much as years ago after so many young ladies starved themselves. Not enough of them tried to have the nice figure of Ursala Andress and we are finally making up for it.Having lived long enough to remember the late Connery, Lazenby, late Moore, Dalton, Brosnan, late Niven, late Nelson, and Craig is a feat unto itself. Nelson's Climax TV episode live performance of 007 in 1954 led to all the others. It has been an amazing road. While the plots have changed and remained the same, Director Cary Joji Fukunaga does an amazing job making this film feel like it is supposed too. Armstrong at the end is a reminder of how much has changed since all this began. Louis, we've had all the time in the world to follow Bond every step of the way.",positive
"NO TIME TO DIE, with a record-breaking 163-minute length, runs out of steam halfway through, after the Cuban part to be specific, where a bombshell Paloma (de Armas, lissom, light-hearted and lethal) knocks us dead with boffolas and her pliability. After that the situation gets glummer, the story goes more formulaic, take the example of the scene where Blofeld (Waltz), the head of SPECTRE, pops his clogs. It is designed to give audience a God's view (we know what is going to happen but Bond doesn't) with Bond suddenly losing his sangfroid and getting steamed up, all just to let him unknowingly pass the nanobots to Blofeld, it is too obvious a plot twist, wielded without much tact though.read my full review on my blog: Cinema Omnivore, thanks.",negative
"For how long and boring this is, you'll actually have plenty of time to die.Wow. This isn't just the most plain looking James Bond movie, it's one of the most ick looking and feeling movies I've seen in a long time. So lifeless, meaningless and despite the significance of this movie - Daniel Craig's last time as Bond, so get ready for a reboot next time, I seriously cannot recommend this film to anyone.Once again, Bond has retired (I think this is his 12th retirement) and found the love of his life (also, 12th ""true love,"") but an old foe is bringing him back in for Queen and Country.I simply cannot get over how dull this movie looks and how uninterested the actors were for being here. We even had two incredible actors as Bond Villains: Christoph Waltz and Rami Malek and both svcked HARD. In fact, Rami seemingly got acting lessons from Eddie Redmayne in Jupiter Ascending. Makes sense since they're both Oscar winners and both whisper their way as sleepy villains.Admittedly there are mere moments of delightful cinematography on screen and some of the jokes landed, but there is absolutely nothing here that would/should justify the nearly 3-hour, slowly paced movie. I appreciate them adding in so many of the normal Bond tropes, and yet, even those felt like they just had to be there.I'm sure Craig got paid a lot and good for him. I didn't hate this movie like I did with Spectre, but it did make me want this Craig era to be over. Sad. When he started it all in Casino Royale, 15 years ago, he quickly became my favorite Bond (and with that movie, my favorite Bond song and overall chapter) and now I'm shooing him away and praying the next one will take its time to perfect it with someone who actually cares about playing this historic role.***Final Thoughts: At least we finally found out what ""Q"" stands for.",negative
"I'm not a big fan of the daniel craig james bond series (ratings in order, 5, 5, 7, 5). But i love action movies. This is more of the same, but longer and slower. It tested my patience. It's generally well made with some good action but not a single scene i will remember in a week. And by the end, during the climax, i just wanted it to be over so i could leave.Also, i was excited to see what rami malek could do with the villain role. He was the first name in the credits (other than daniel craig). ""starring rami malek."" yet he was in the movie for about 11 minutes. The movie is 2 hours and 43 minutes long. How does he have zero character development and unclear motivations? The villain character (not the actor) added nothing to this movieCaveat: i didn't revisit the previous movies so i wasn't able to follow some of the references to previous movies.

"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningJames Bond (Daniel Craig) has retired from active service, and is now living in Jamaica, with Madeleine (Lea Seydoux), the girl from his last encounter with SPECTRE. All seems well, until a series of attempts on his life leads him to think she might be behind it. Meanwhile, in London, an armed break in at a chemical laboratory results in the apparent kidnapping of Dr. Obruchev (David Denicik.) It all leads to the path of incarcerated criminal Lyetsifer Safin (Rami Malek), setting a course for Bond and Madeleine's paths to intersect once again.It has felt like a lifetime ago now that the massive hype and eager anticipation for Daniel Craig's final Bond film was first about, before the unthinkable global pandemic struck, and the release date got set all the way back to the present day, where it has absolutely smashed global box office records. At five films, Craig has lasted the course as long as the original greats Connery and Moore, his image now as personified in the character as those whose shoes he had to fill.With that in mind, it's ironic that director Cary Joui Fukanaga pays such an homage to the Bond film starring George Lazenby, who played him only once, in the shape of On Her Majesty's Secret Service, with Louis Armstrong's melodic theme song We Have All the Time in the World playing over the soundtrack at various points, as well as the downbeat fatalism that defined that Bond outing from all the others. Craig's Bond has been a grittier, more hard edged Bond in general, and in its bowing out here, Fukanaga goes Hell for leather, cranking the brutal intensity of Craig's last four Bond entries all together, and giving it everything with a film running over two and a half hours, with some light humour awkwardly inserted in.It's the final part of what defines Craig's Bond, and in that it's everything you expect it to be, ur it's also a love song to the Bond franchise in general, from the more modern, unflinching stuff, right through to the 'secret organisation' stuff when it began in the 60's nearly sixty years ago, that everyone won't be able to help loving. ****",positive
"They tried to tell us it's too long and at 163 minutes ""No Time to Die"" is indeed the longest of the Bond movies but don't let that colour your judgement; this is still one hell of a rollercoaster ride and if Daniel Craig, in his final appearance as Commander Bond, is looking his age, remember he's now 'retired' and probably closer in demeanour to a middle-aged spy than at any time in the franchise. You must also remember that the Craig Bond's, unlike those of his predecessors, have followed a trajectory from ""Casino Royale"", (the first of the Ian Fleming novels), right through to the present, each one a kind of sequel to the one before and while Craig may not be everyone's favourite Bond he is, at least, unique in that respect. You might even say the entire Bond saga belongs to him.The next point to consider, of course, is is it any good or rather is it as good as the others and the answers to both questions is a resounding yes. This is an action flic of the first order, exciting, funny and, for the most part, intelligent. It's also surprisingly old-fashioned. Here is a Bond movie that goes back to the roots of the franchise, all the way to ""Dr. No"" in fact. The gadgets are still there and used to good effect but this is a much more character driven piece and in Rami Malek it has one of the great Bond villains, (could Malek become the first Bond villain to pick up an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor?).Admittedly the plot is quite far-fetched. We may not be in ""Moonraker"" territory but you may still have to see the film twice just to figure out what's going on. Also in keeping with previous Craig Bond's it's not afraid to introduce plot twists that should have a lasting impact on the series, presuming, of course, that the producers wish audiences to take any forthcoming films seriously. In what we now know will be his last appearance in the role it would be nice to say that this is Craig's film and while he certainly brings gravitas to the part it is Malek who steals the movie and if the film itself isn't quite the best of the series it's certainly up there. If this doesn't bring the punters in, nothing will.",negative
"One of my guilty pleasures as a moviegoer is watching James Bond movies and I have no intention of apologising for that. Thus, I watched as soon as I had the opportunity 'No Time to Die' directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga, the latest film in the series, whose release has already been postponed several times and which finally meets the screens and its viewers this cinematic fall of the year 2021. The James Bond film series is approaching the age of 60. All Bond movies start from the same premises and have the same hero, but the way he looks and behaves and the structuring of the story have evolved over time. This says a lot about how cinematic entertainment was and is perceived and accepted in the movies of the big studios.A lot has happened during these years. The hero evolved from the nonchalant and humorous commander in Fleming's books and played by Sean Connery to the complex and gloomy character in the last series, played by Daniel Craig. The original 007 had gone through the experience of World War II and was active during the Cold War. He was excused for his womanising as many things are excused to war heroes, and there was no room for moral doubt concerning his actions because he lived in an age when it was clear who were the good guys and who were the bad guys. Thee 21st century James Bond lives and acts in the turbulent era after the fall of communism and after the novels of John Le Carre were written. Today's enemies are not ideological, and screenwriters of such films (not just those in the Bond series) often prefer not to identify them politically, ethnically, or religiously. On the other hand, the romantic implications of the character are no longer devoid of substance. James no longer conquers but falls in love. From Bond the Don Juan we now (almost) get Bond the family man. One of the qualities of the script in 'No Time to Die' is that it manages to describe at this stage of the character's evolution a story that is acceptable by today's standards of the big studios and is somewhat credible in terms of character psychology. Craig's James Bond has been throughout this series and is in this film also a real character, not just a two-dimensional comics book figure.What I liked about 'No Time to Die'? Daniel Craig. Action scenes, car chases and stunts that show ingenuity in a few moments (just when we thought we saw everything in this area) and use the landscapes spectacularly, especially in Italian villages. Humour and self-humour. The presence of Ralph Fiennes, an actor who can do anything on screen and I will like it. Ana de Armas, a classic Bond-girl who I hope will survive until the next series. What I liked less? Rami Malek, an actor who constantly disappoints me and who plays a mediocre bad guy here. Lea Seydoux is OK, but her relationship with Bond lacks chemistry. The dose of melodrama introduced in the script towards the end. The scientific pretext, which is thin and I could not understand what they were brewing in those pools (not that it would be important).'No Time to Die' honorably concludes the Daniel Craig chapter of the Bond epic. It's not the best Bond I've ever seen, but it's above average. I look forward to the next reincarnation.",positive
"For the most part, I liked No Time to Die. However, I feel like it tried to do too much. They could have shaved 30 minutes off and its aim would have been more precise. I absolutely loved Ana de Armas as Paloma, though, and wish we could have seen more of her character. Without getting into spoilers, there's a finality to this film that feels somewhat out of place in the Bond franchise, but I understand why the filmmakers did it. I still feel like Spectre would have been a fitting farewell for Daniel Craig.",positive
"Michael Myers escapes a prisoner transport bus crash (they only move prisoners on Halloween) and returns to kill people. A vigilante group lead by previous survivors goes out to hunt him down. Do I need to tell you how it turns out?They didn't kill off Jamie Lee Curtis and her role was limited. I don't know what to say except, been there, done that, got the t-shirt. It is not bad and is keeping in line with the series. (The main series and not the Rob Zombie porn.)Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",negative
"Let's be clear, if you are out for a story, you very likely will not like this Halloween movie. There is little to none here, the focus being the Kills (duh, I know, the title is sort of a giveaway, right?). But it is not just the Kills, it is all the small roles from the Original finally getting their 15 minutes of fame - though for some it is way less than that.Now if you suspend your disbelief enough (especially when it comes to what makes sense or not, like how the Killer looks and who is being chased in the Hospital to name one example), you are going to be able to be quite entertained by this. It is a fan service - but it also may dissapoint some fans. Especially those who are here for Jamie Lee Curtis character - she is quite passive in this movie to put it mildly.That being said, there is enough tension here and the violence level is as high as any horror fan would wish it to be. There is even a scene with firefighters (and another one later on), that may remind you of action movies rather than horror. Still it works and the stunts and effects are as good as they can get.Giving us a motivation for Myers is kind of a risk - even more so, because apparently that does not involve Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) ... even if a sequel was not already announced, you'd know there is never an end. Even if there is one ... don't be mad at the characters here who seem oblivious to that fact ... even if they sort of come up with an explanation for the ""unstoppable"" force that is Michael Myers.A lot of throwbacks and winks to the fans of the original, starting once again with the opening credits. Love it or take it as pandering - up to you to decide. But you're better off if you go with the flow.",negative
"The latest saga in the world of Halloween, what an absolute mix of good and bad this was. It has the same feel as Halloween 2, the first time I saw that, a slightly patchy follow up.The previous film I really rather enjoyed, I was hoping for this to follow the trend, where the had the vibe of a horror thriller, this ventures more into the horror fantasy genre, Michael is transformed into some unearthly killing machine.The opening few minutes were awesome, I loved what they did, and how they did it, creative, well realised, and somehow respectful, it was incredible, it really did work. The core of the film was as you would expect, lots of gore, lots of violence, and the ending was again a mix of good and bad. It didn't have much in the way of suspense.The only upsetting death here for me, was the suicide, that was about the only time the screen went silent, it was a very upsetting moment.My favourite characters were Big and Little John, those guys were really good fun.It'll have its fans and its haters, for the season it's a thrill ride, does it enhance The Halloween catalogue, sadly not, it lacked structure, it lacked a cohesive narrative, it was just a killing spree slasher.6/10.",negative
"Halloween Kills was pretty much what I expected it to be; after all, when do we expect anything highbrow in these movies? I did like Laurie's analysis of evil and how it transfers, though.",negative
"The previous film, a reboot disqualifying all events from previous sequels, was a great return to form for the franchise, this follow-up was delayed by a year due to COVID-19, so I was hoping it was worth the wait, directed by David Gordon Green (Pineapple Express, The Sitter). Basically, it opens with a flashback to 31 October 1978, the police are on the hunt for murderer Michael Myers (Nick Castle, the original Michael from 1978, and James Jude Courtney). Michael is cornered when he returns to his childhood home, but Deputy Frank Hawkins (Thomas Mann) accidentally shoots his partner dead while trying to save him from the killer. Michael is eventually caught, surrounded by many officers outside the house, and is incarcerated for forty years, until his escape. Returning to the present, Halloween night 2018, teenager Cameron Elam (Dylan Arnold) finds the dead body of Dr. Ranbir Sartain and calls an ambulance for Hawkins (Will Patton) who was left for dead after Sartain stabbed him. Meanwhile, Tommy Doyle (Anthony Michael Hall), who witnessed the attacks of Michael Myers in 1978, is in a bar with fellow survivors Marion Chambers (Nancy Stephens, reprising her 1978 role), Lindsey Wallace (Kyle Richards, reprising her 1978 role), and Cameron's father, Lonnie Elam (Robert Longstreet) to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Michael's imprisonment. Meanwhile, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) has escaped the house fire with her daughter Karen Nelson (Judy Greer), and her granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak). Firefighters responding to burning house unknowingly release Michael, who slaughters them with their own equipment. The trio are taken to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital, where Laurie undergoes emergency surgery, while Michael continues his killing spree while heading back to town. Tommy, Marion, Lindsey, and Lonnie hear of Michael's return from an emergency news report. Bar patrons Vanessa (Carmela McNeal) and her husband Marcus (Michael Smallwood) supposedly encounter Michael in her car, but the unseen driver escapes unnoticed. Tommy forms a mob of vengeful Haddonfield residents to hunt down and kill Michael. Karen is informed that Michael is still alive but hides this from Laurie to allow her to recover. Allyson reconciles with Cameron, her ex-boyfriend, and she joins Tommy's mob to avenge the death of her father. Laurie and Hawkins both awaken in the same room and reminisce about their former relationship. Hawkins admits that he regrets not allowing Dr. Sam Loomis to execute Michael given the opportunity and vows to kill him. While warning the Haddonfield community to stay inside, Marion, Vanessa, and Marcus are killed by Michael. Lindsey escapes and is found alive by Tommy, Lonnie, Allyson, and Cameron. The group map out Michael's path and deduce that he is heading towards his childhood home. Tommy takes Lindsey to the hospital and reunites with former Haddonfield sheriff Leigh Brackett (Charles Cyphers), whose daughter Annie was killed in 1978, and informs Laurie about Michael's survival. Michael's childhood home is now owned by gay couple Big John (Scott MacArthur) and Little John (Michael McDonald), Michael breaks in and murders them. While Laurie tries to leave, convict Lance Tovoli, who escaped Smith's Grove Psychiatric Hospital following the bus crash, and stole Vanessa's car, arrives at the hospital. The scared criminal is mistaken for Michael, Tommy's mob pursue him through the hospital, but Karen realises that he is not Michael. Despite her attempts to calm the mob and help Lance, he jumps out a window to his death. Tommy and the mob realise that Michael has turned them into ""monsters"" themselves because of their rage for his crimes. Laurie urges Karen to work with Tommy and Brackett to hunt Michael down. Elsewhere, Lonnie heads in alone to Michael's home and is killed. Allyson and Cameron also turn up and find Lonnie's body, and Michael attacks them, murdering Cameron. As Michael prepares to kill Allyson, Karen stabs him in the back with a pitchfork, steals his mask, and taunts him to follow her. She leads Michael towards Tommy's mob, who swarm, attack, and seemingly kill him. When the mob disperses, Michael recovers and massacres the entire mob, including Tommy and Brackett. Back at Michael's home, Karen finds Allyson who needs medical attention. Michael appears and stabs Karen to death in Judith Myers's old bedroom as Laurie stares out of her hospital room. Also starring Jim Cummings as Pete McCabe, Brian Mays as Brian the Bartender, Omar J. Dorsey as Sheriff Barker and Tom Jones Jr. As Dr. Samuel Loomis (a spitting image of Donald Pleasance). As before, Curtis goes from post-traumatic stressed victim to determined fighter wanting to end the maniac's reign of terror, and the indestructible killer is menacing enough. The previous film felt a bit fresher and more exciting, whereas this follow-up feels a bit samey, using the same predictable formular and slightly silly dialogue as past instalments, at least the over-the-top violence and inventive kills work well, and the fear of the people having consequences stuff is interesting, all in all, it is an alright slasher horror. Worth watching!",positive
"Those who thought that Rob Zombie was the worst thing to happen to Halloween, think again. David Gordon Green is the new boogeyman, out to terrorise fans of the original film with his atrocious approach to all things Michael Myers. I thought that his Halloween (2018) was pretty bad, but this follow up is an absolute travesty: the tone is all wrong, the dialogue is laughable, and the acting sucks. Sure, it features plenty of gory kills - and god knows, I love my splatter - but Halloween has never been about the gore. It's about atmosphere, palpable suspense, sheer terror, with believable characters you can care about. And Halloween Kills has none of that.Following a flashback to the aftermath of events in Carpenter's original classic (complete with CGI-enhanced Donald Pleasence lookalike), the film picks up immediately after Green's previous film, Laurie Strode and family driving away from the burning house in which Michael is trapped, presumably gone forever. Except that Michael never dies, and when a firefighter crew turns up to tackle the blaze, the killer emerges from the burning building to slaughter the lot of them.From there-on in, the film consists of a series of graphic murders at the hands of the 'boogeyman', resulting in the townsfolk of Haddonfield declaring enough is enough, and forming a mob to track down Michael and put an end to his grisly shenanigans once and for all. Don't they ever learn? Writer/director Green, once again assisted by Danny McBride, fills his script with characters who act and talk like idiots, and frequently places them in perilous situations from which they could easily run away, but never do. There are numerous touches of comedy throughout, none of which has any place in a Halloween movie. There's nothing funny about Michael!Jamie Lee Curtis is given nothing to do but pontificate from a hospital bed about the nature of evil. She's not alone: several characters expound long, boring and completely unnecessary theories about why Michael kills, when all we need to know is that he is pure, unbridled evil. It's been said before, and doesn't need expanding upon.There are so many awful scenes in the film that it's a tough call to pick the worst...The gay couple (who call themselves Big John and Little John) checking their house for an intruder is a serious contender, especially when the second bloke (Big or Little... I can't remember) spots Michael and just stands there waiting to be killed.Or could the lousiest scene be the attack on the car in the park, in which Michael kills one of his victims by kicking the car door, causing the person to shoot themselves in the head (it actually pains me to type that!)?Or does the film hit its nadir when Tommy Doyle (an embarrassingly bad performance from Anthony Michael Hall) rallies the masses in the hospital into finding and killing Michael? The crowd, chanting the slogan 'Evil dies tonight' ad nauseum, spots one of Michael's fellow escaped lunatics (who just so happens to wander into the building at the wrong time) and assume he is the killer. They chase him and trap him in a corridor. Terrified, the loony smashes a window and falls to his death on the concrete below. It's a terrible scene that adds nothing to the film except for the messy sight of a smashed body on the ground.In another ill-advised move, Green tries to placate long-time Halloween fans with nods to previous movies, the most obvious being the inclusion of the deadly masks from Halloween 3. It's not a clever touch: it's just a reminder that even the much-maligned (unfairly so) Season of the Witch is a far better film than the one we are currently watching.The movie's ending - another possible choice for most ludicrous moment - sees Tommy and his chanting followers finally cornering Michael and bludgeoning and stabbing him, then turning their back on him, only for Michael to stand back up and get in a few more kills before the closing credits. It's bad, not only for the way that the people allow themselves to be slaughtered so easily, but for the fact that it heralds another sequel: Halloween Ends, coming October 2022 (how I hope that the film lives up to its title).1/10 - I don't hand out the lowest rating lightly, but the way this film trashes the legacy of the original movie, it deserves it.",negative
"Follow-up to, among other films in the canon, 2018's ""Halloween"", again directed by David Gordon Green, rather adroitly ties in flashbacks to--and new events from--that film and John Carpenter's original ""Halloween"" from 1978 (with Donald Pleasence lookalike Tom Jones Jr playing Dr. Loomis). Haddonfield survivors from '78's rampage band together with the 2018 characters to take down boogeyman Michael Myers, who somehow escaped the fire set by Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) in the last installment. But what begins as an interesting concept soon turns into yet another illogical hack-'em-up, with Michael's victims acting like foolish sitting ducks (in a ridiculous sequence, Michael eliminates each member of a firefighting team--one at a time, because that's the way they do things in these movies--leaving the whole crew decimated). Curtis, recovering from surgery at Haddonfield Hospital, consoles a wounded police officer who blames himself for Michael's killing spree (seems he stopped Loomis from shooting Michael in the head in 1978--but, since Myers ""isn't flesh and blood like the rest of us"", the conversation isn't useful or productive). When an angry mob finally encircles Michael and has him on the ground, one might think executive producers Curtis and Carpenter would be happy to call it a night...not in Haddonfield, it seems, nor in sequel-hungry Hollywood. *1/2 from ****",negative
"First of all, I must admit that I have never really been much of a friend of the ""Halloween"" franchise, though I have seen all the movies. Might seem odd, right? Well, you're right. Sure, I've seen all the movies as I do enjoy horror movies and slasher movies, but I've just never warmed as much up to ""Halloween"" as I did for franchises like ""Friday the 13th"" and ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"".So when this 2021 addition to the ""Halloween"" franchise was announced, I wasn't just exactly thrilled. But as I had the opportunity to watch it, of course I did sit down to do so.And sure, ""Halloween Kills"" is a watchable movie, and it certainly is among the better of the ""Halloween"" franchise since the original movie. But I have to say, though, that this wasn't a milestone in horror cinema by any account.The storyline told in ""Halloween Kills"" is adequate, although I found a bit unnecessary. But it made for adequate entertainment, given the sheer brutality of the murders committed by Michael Myers. And yeah, there were some pretty cool-looking kills in the movie, I will say that much. And those alone actually make the movie well worth watching.Sure, I was thrilled to have Jamie Lee Curtis return to the movie - yet again - but she didn't really play that much of a big role throughout the movie, so it was somewhat disappointing. But of course it was nice to see her in the movie, and she did add a good element to the movie. Judy Greer actually put on a good performance in the movie.Visually then ""Halloween Kills"" is top notch. It is a dark and gritty movie, and they definitely upped the game in terms of visceral kills that puts you right in the slaughtering gore.""Halloween Kills"" is a watchable and entertaining enough movie if you enjoy slasher movies, and it will definitely bring enjoyment to the fans of the franchise, of that I am quite sure.My rating of ""Halloween Kills"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",positive
"There's no way to be wrong or right about how you feel about this movie, but tell that to the sycophantic fanboy audience that has already told people to kill themselves if they didn't like this movie. Yes, after a lifetime of dealing with hard knocks, the thing that finally kills me is a bottom-of-the-barrel slasher that wouldn't even place in the top fifty films of this genre that came out in 1981*.First off, that's not fair, as a metric ton of slashers came out that year. But also, a lot of really great ones did that did at the time weren't thought of as being all that great, but in retrospect - and with the law of withering slasher quality - seem like bona fide classics in 2021.I debated just sharing with you my alternate titles for this film** instead of my thoughts, but that seemed like a cop-out.So...if you haven't seen it yet...spoiler warning.Mommy, please don't let me read them spoilers...About a decade ago, I had the feeling coming out of Pineapple Express that was, ""Yeah, so...what did I miss?"" And I've continually felt that feeling with nearly every movie that David Gordon Green has made.The one thing that people seemed to agree on about the last film - Halloween - was that it worked best when it was when it let the Strode women - Laurie, Karen and Allyson - kick some ass. This film takes a cue from Halloween II - and not the one that works - and basically keeps Laurie*** and her family out of the action for a large chunk of the running time, instead of devoting its running time to a group of doomed survivors led by Tommy Doyle (Anthony Michael Hall) and including fan service**** character Lonnie Elam (Robert Longstreet), Lindsay Wallace (Kyle Richards) and Marion Chambers (Nancy Stephens) as they drink in a bar and remember the night that they all almost died, ruining the worst talent show ever so that Tommy can remind us that nothing bad has ever happened to him since forty years ago and generally bumming everyone out.Somehow, Deputy Frank Hawkins (Will Patton in 2018, Thomas Mann in 1978) survived being stabbed in the throat by living plot device Dr. Ranbir Sartain in the last film, which leads him to remember all the things we didn't see at the end of the original movie, like him screwing up and shooting a cop in the throat instead of The Shape, followed up by him having all the marksmanship of a Cobra trooper or clone of Jango Fett and then, finally, stopping Dr. Loomis (Tom Jones, Jr. Under a load of makeup) from shooting Michael right in the head.Halloween Kills is a movie that simultaneously wants us to remember it as the one true sequel to a film that's had more timelines than most slashers have quarts of blood while also having its cake as well, showing us Leigh Brackett in footage from the second film in the series which it has conveniently retconned out.Speaking of that, the new reason why Michael kills people is so hilarious that I laughed out loud to the point that you may have heard me, wherever you are. He likes to look out the window all the time into the darkness in his soul, so whenever he's done killing, he just likes to look out that window and if anyone gets in the way of him and his window, they die. Kind of like the mirror in Boogeyman but somehow in no way better, which is beyond a crying shame.Yes. All these years of murder and dread and sorrow and fear and it was all about a window.So anyways...I really don't even know if I want to go on after that. By that point, I was borderline enraged in the theater and upset that we challenged a global health crisis instead of being smart and just watching this on Peacock.Anyways, let's soldier on.After Michael raises the ire of first responders online - hey, I'm still mad about him eating dogs, which I'm reminded of again in this one, so get in line - with a massacre of the very firemen sent to save him, The Shape is loose again like some kind of apex predator or Jaws with his burned up face and out and about and randomly killing comedy geek favorites like Lenny Clark and Michael McDonald (making him the only person I know to get killed by Michael Myers the actor and Michael Myers the killer in a movie).For all the critiques of just how rough Halloween II is - and yes, it is, but it's also a movie not even in the same breath as this one - the violence in this movie goes beyond even what my usual slasher dreams entail. There's a saw to the face. A light tube to the throat. Multiple knives in Uncle Teddy's back. A cheese knife to Stewart's heart. And yet, in the midst of all this grand guignol, something hit me.The moment that makes Halloween stand out is when Michael murders Bob and takes a moment to step back, cock his head and admire his handiwork. It shows how detached that he is from the human race. He does that move exactly one time in the original film. He does it six times before I lost track in this film. And that's one of the many issues here: this is a bloated film, losing the plot of more than one story while overdoing it. It isn't enough to have one person yell ""Evil dies tonight!"" It happens over and over and over when someone should have said to Nurse Chambers, ""C'mon, inventing that tagline is as bad as picking your own nickname."" But everyone follows suit and before you can say Q-Anon, we have Tommy Doyle drunkenly taking the streets and making perfect charisma rolls to convince the town of Haddonfield - which no doubt has the worst kids ever between the jerks in this one and the bullies of the fourth one which does not exist - to come together in the beautiful dream of surrounding one man and beating him to death.Haddonfield's citizens are themselves turning into monsters! Why, as Laurie later says, this is Michael's masterpiece! But didn't we just also learn that Michael had nothing to do with finding the woman who is not his sister as he was put in her way by Dr. Sartain and everything is a coincidence? If he's a six-year-old child in the body of an adult - one nearing seventy mind you - how can he plan these things? Or perhaps is he supernatural and gains his powers with each person he kills, as Laurie later says? Is he flesh and blood? Or is he a demon? Are we going to cut to him having a Cult of Thorn tattoo just to confuse everyone?Ah man, we still have Halloween Ends to get to, which Green has said is a ""coming of age story"" in which ""some of the characters... have processed the insanity of the circus of the massacre of 2018. And not only that, but they've also processed the world as it's spun so wildly in the last four years.""So yeah. The crappy world outside that I ventured out into in the hopes of escaping the world outside by watching a slasher is now intruding into said slasher. Cool.Again, for a movie that wants us to believe that it is the one and only timeline, the idea of a vigilante mob after Michael comes directly from the fourth movie. And the best parts of this only happen in flashbacks.I mean, at least this movie didn't have a long discussion of bahn mi sandwiches, instead deciding to show how quirky and cool it was by featuring a moment from Minnie and Moskowitz and characters listening to Pete Antell's ""Stop, Look and Listen, It's Halloween."" It doesn't feel like bonus content and something cool. It feels extraneous.Actually, this whole thing feels extraneous.Then again, it's also the kind of movie that has The Guardian saying that it's the new high in ""horror renaissance"" and has Variety critics saying that it's a ripoff of Texas Chainsaw Massacre and then doubling down by saying Mario Bava was inept.Much like the mob that's created in the film, this is a dumb piece of nothing that creates more moments of absolute dumbness. And within said dumbness, there is no moment of joy, no love for craft, no escape. Halloween has become a commitment, a movie that you have to go see because you've endured all the others and there's no way this can be worse than that time that Freddie Harris spin kicked Michael or when he had a neckflap.But it is. Somehow, it's worse.*Off the top of my head, the 1981 slashers that are light years better than this movie include Absurd (which is my third favorite Halloween movie), Bloody Moon (yes, when Jess Franco makes a better movie than your Hollywood budget, get the axe), Don't Go in the Woods...Alone! (which sucks, but I love, and it's actually made with love unlike this), Madhouse, Just Before Dawn (I mean, that's like comparing...actually in the future I will use the example ""That's like comparing Just Before Dawn to Halloween Kills), Madman, Dark Night of the Scarecrow, The Fan, The Funhouse, Happy Birthday to Me, Hell Night (the very best example of a movie people hated in 1981 that's had forty years to suddenly seem pretty decent), My Bloody Valentine, Strange Behavior, Butcher Baker Nightmare Maker and two of the best slashers ever made, Halloween II and The Prowler.**Those alternate titles include:Halloween: January 6 Halloween: Make Haddonfield Great Again Halloween: Surprisingly Not a Fan Film Halloween: Just Wait Until You See These Guys Ruin The Exorcist Too Halloween: Did Someone Say ""Evil Dies Tonight?"" Halloween: Rob Zombie's Redemption Halloween: Wherefore Art Thou, Busta Rhymes?Halloween: Cookie Woman Returns Halloween: Donald Pleasence Says Yes to a Role Beyond the Grave Halloween: Two Old People Make Funny In Adjoining Hospital Beds Halloween: Window Licker Halloween: The Kids Are Not Alright Halloween: Gratutitous Bob Odenkirk Stock Photo ***This is the only movie in the series where Laurie and Michael don't have a scene together.****To be fair, this is an entire movie of fan service that seems worse than many of the fan films of Halloween that I have seen. Oh cool, the Silver Shamrock masks, they want you to yell, while inside you realize that Carpenter was right and this should have ended with the second film and become an annual series of unconnected stories.",negative
"I haven't watched the previous Halloween films, so I don't really connect with the story. Actually, there's little story. It is just an excuse to film gory death scenes. I found it boring.",negative
"Ah, had only the contents of the trail been a tease for the rest of the film, rather than a reasonably comprehensive depiction of the best bits! Regrettably, this is a pretty poorly stitched-together rehash of the original with a rarely seen Jamie Lee Curtis still on the hunt for the murderous ""Michael Myers"". He is still loose, and is wreaking havoc - but how can they they track him down and stop him? I have to say that by around half an hour in, I felt that with no notable exceptions, the entire town of gung-ho eejits deserved all they could get from their avenging tormentor. The ""evil dies tonight"" nonsense just made me cringe, almost as much as the truly mediocre acting on display; a script - pretty much entirely devoid of humour - that could have been written by one of his victims and an ending, well I am sure you can guess. There are the odd scenes that are gory, but for the most part it is a poorly assembled and structured story that culminates in a pretty risible last ten minutes. Sorry - I know this film will appeal to ""Halloween"" die hards, and I was delighted to see it play to an almost full cinema on a Friday night (I saw ""Malignant"" (2021) in the same screen four weeks ago all by myself), but it's really all rather a let down.",negative
"While not perfect, this installment in the Halloween franchise was quite effective. The entire audience was screaming and shouting and just in general having a spooktacular time. The storyline was modern but yet paid homage to the original. The scares, the gore, the stupid decisions, it all came together to make one killer movie.",positive
"Michael Myers(Jude Courtney and Castle, at his most sadistic, leading to an extreme body count and incredibly grisly gore. Some have questioned whether we're actually supposed to find it disgusting, and feel ashamed that we're continuing to watch. They have a point) survived, because of course he did(...well, no, I'm not complaining). Never underestimate the power of fan interest and profit motive. Once word spreads, so does a strong drive to stop him. This leads to armed mobs of civilians roaming the streets, trying to find and stop him. But are they actually counterproductive?Did they seriously try to put a message inside of a Halloween movie? Yes, and while I understand those who say that it ruins the film, in my opinion, it works more often than not. Unlike the 1980s, you can no longer simply do a slasher flick(a sub-genre that I continue to love) and expect people to be passionate about it; you have to be offering something else. The previous entry used an exploration of PTSD(which this tries to replicate, here expanding beyond the scope of one person and how that ruined her family, to an entire town, with mixed results) and a lot of elements that very heavily homage the 1978 original, to the point where its plot structure, among other things, is extremely similar. You can think of that one as proving to the fans that they share their love of John Carpenter's masterpiece, and that we should give them a chance with a more unique vision for the franchise. For my money, this one does do a largely great job at that. The fan service, however, is excessive, and often does more to hamper the overall effect than to improve the final result. Yes, bringing back so many of the OG cast members is impressive, no, sadly it did lead to this being overstuffed.I recommend this to huge fans of the two in the series that are in continuity with this, and make sure you watched them very recently, or you will definitely be confused. 7/10.",positive
"HALLOWEEN KILLS (2021) *** Jamie Lee Curtis, Judy Greer, Andi Matichak, James Jude Courtney, Nick Castle, Will Patton, Thomas Mann, Jim Cummings, Dylan Arnold, Robert Longstreet, Anthony Michael Hall, Charles Cyphers, Scott MacArthur, Michael McDonald, Kyle Richards, Nancy Stephens. Filmmaker David Gordon Green (who re-unites on the screenplay with Scott Teems & Danny McBride) returns to the scene of the crime from HALLOWEEN (2018) where the attempted kill of Michael Myers by the long-suffering Laurie Strode (Curtis back in Mama Bear mode) fails to stick to the landing letting The Shape continue his bloody carnage of vengeance & homecoming, albeit amidst Haddonfield up-in-arms with a vigilante group let by Strode's former babysitting charge Tommy Doyle (Hall). While there are some impressively cool kills with so many annoying new characters to knock off, and a decent body count the film only suffers in very little for Curtis to do let alone have a moment with her sibling rivalry. Leaves the door wide open for the penultimate HALLOWEEN ENDS then.",positive
"Starts exactly were the 2018 left us. So if you do wants to understand the fire and the bleeding Laurie just watch the 2018 one first. Once you did it's time for this one.What I did like was the moment they explained what happened with Michael back in the seventies, his first kill on Halloween, take-outs from the first and second Halloween flick and they used Dr Loomis which made it so real. I was stunned. Opening titles, and then we go to the fire. Nice to see Michael coming out of the house, a bit exaggerated what he did with the fire brigade.Killings are messy and just on the edge of being gory but then it lost my attention a bit. To much blah blah, long time no see from Michael, laurie not being in it that much, left me bitter. The final did deliver and the final scene, well, you know what we can expect.So overall it's not that bad but it's still the same as always. Don't worry, better than the older ones in the early franchise.Gore 1,5/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5.",negative
"Not as bad as I thought but not that good either! Halloween kills is not as bad as the woke predecessor! There was no woke Hollywood insulting 2 d characters of the macho super hero female character, the Lisa Simpon over explaining back female character, and the self doubt guy who cries and whimpers every 30 seconds annoying character. Halloween Kills actually has depth character, which reflects real people that the audience can relate with. Empathy for the victims and a story about the past fears tells a great past story. A good retro movie about a small town in fear. I thought wow real story development the first third was solid story environmental development. Suddenly, Halloween Kills has the town of Haddenfield turn into a un trained community watch group which is hunting for Michael Myers. Well written and directed until the mid point with a social message about mob riots which creates true evil town. In the end Michael is bulletproof, fire proof and indestructible to chains and bats. Maybe, a flamethrower would of worked. A disappointment ending. That is it ending there should of been more 5 stars.",negative
"For Halloween yesterday I watched the new Candyman and Halloween Kills. Both movies have been done repeatedly and to be honest at one point enough should be enough. Candyman wasn't bad though but it's nothing like the first movie when it was all a surprise. Halloween Kills on the other hand is just another movie too much. Nothing new, Michael Myers can't be killed, it doesn't matter if you stab him, shoot him, set him on fire, he just can't be killed nor injured. It's getting lame to be honest. Jamie Lee Curtis hasn't a huge role and that was maybe best like that. I hope this one was finally the last one because there's no milk to be milked anymore here.",negative
"If like me and a fan of the ""Halloween"" movie series then you probably have seen ""Halloween Kills"", as it picks up and off after 2018's ""Halloween"". Really it's plenty of killing, rage, and blood and gore.You find Laurie Strode(Jamie Lee Curtis) in a hospital from her injuries and the film also does fine to flashback in time to show the past of other characters and how the story and saga has continued since 1978. As many clips and scenes are shown from Carpenter's 1978 original, the whole town is looking for Michael and blood and gore is spilled it's like you can't keep evil or the boogeyman down. Nothing great still it's a watch if your a fan of the series as the violence and evil blood gore does not stop with this horror legend icon in one Michael Myers.",negative
"Whoo...déjà vu.Halloween did it again. Every time the make a great/very good ending, they botch it with the next installment. Halloween II (1981) Good, Halloween III (in comparison) Bad. Halloween 4 good, Halloween 5 bad. Halloween H20 good, Halloween: Resurrection bad. Halloween (2007) good, Halloween II (2009) bad. And Halloween (2018) GREAT, Halloween Kills...meh.Thanks to Peacock, I'm gonna rewatch this, probably this weekend. For starters, I just finished it and I'm puzzled on how this got made and need to see it again to figure out something, anything. Some clue on what the writers were thinking. It felt like there were 6 writers, none of which met each other followed by 6 editors who just lost their sight.When the movie begins there's a flashback to the original film and my immediate thought: well, that ""looks like the classic, but doesn't feel like it at all. Clearly there were two different directors."" As the movie progressed, I felt the same for the director of both Halloween (2018) and Halloween Kills....even though they are the same person, they looked the same, but felt wildly different.The same part I probably liked best: on how many characters they took from Halloween (2018) I wanted to see more of last time around and had such small roles beforehand. Honestly, I don't have too many more positives here. I think I'm giving it 3/10 stars because I'm biased for this series and characters and while it's bad, it's not Halloween: Resurrection or Halloween II (2009) bad.Hard to describe the plot, but it follows some of the subplots/locations of the original Halloween II, but mixed in a ton of III and 4. Michael's on his set path of destruction, Laurie did even less in the hospital than she did in 1981 and Dr. Loomis shows up and looked even more creepy than Carrie Fisher or Peter Cushing in Rogue One.I believe the next/final (ha) one is named ""Halloween Ends."" If this new trilogy decline in quality continues, I'm gonna HATE the series' climax.

"Completely clueless about what it wants to be or where its priorities lie, Halloween Kills is an absolute trainwreck of a sequel from start to finish. A dull, pointless & thoroughly frustrating entry that fails to capitalise on the blank canvas after the 2018 film wiped the slate clean by retconning the franchise, this latest instalment is an utter mess that's all over the place and unsure of its own identity.Co-written & directed by David Gordon Green, the story shift the focus on other survivors of Michael Myers' 1978 killing spree by sidelining our protagonist yet does it so awfully that we are never for once invested in the new characters. Green does the bare minimum to improve the ride, has no idea what tone to settle with, and branches the story out in directions that's neither warranted nor called for.It attempts to give us a peek of the trauma that Myers inflicted on not just Laurie Strode but the entire Haddonfield community and skims on mob mentality in dumb, facepalm-inducing ways. The film is devoid of tension, build-up & atmosphere, Myers' looming presence is also gone, and the narrative flow & editing is a nightmare. The only aspects working in its favour are the grisly kills & Carpenter's score.Overall, Halloween Kills features a healthy dose of gnarly kills & slasher brutality but the rest is not only underwhelming, it's almost cringeworthy. The callbacks are mere distractions, the subplots lead nowhere, performances are forgettable, and it really made me root for Michael Myers as he creatively slaughters a lot of stupid, annoying folks in this. A wasted potential at best, this newest chapter adds nothing to the saga.",negative
"I'm confused.I'm not sure, butM. M was a rockstar. Not a bad film, bad something were missing. I think they should not tell us they are making 3rd movie. This film is a filler.P. S : Of course people are (in the movie) are so stupid :)",negative
"Not easy to follow, jumps back and forth to the other halloween nights where mr myers have tortured this city. There has now been made far to many sequels to this mm caracter, maybe its time to give him the final push into the purgatory???But urban legends will survive nevertheless, and for the halloween industry ,flicks like this makes money in the cash register and sows fright and agony in every new trick or treat generation, i'm happy that the tradition is very sparse over here rural norway(its an urban phenomenon mostly)...theres nothing new here, some more gore and advanced special effects, but the idea is the same. So for me the grumpy old man the music will alwaysgive an adrenaline kick, the rest is just an average repeat of the past, just a could see film, cause there are better films on the present market.",negative
"Halloween Kills is a Thriller - Horror movie and another movie of the ""Halloween"" franchise, in which we continue the story of Laurie Strode from the end of the previous movie. Michael Myers is again free and he is searching for his next victim.Since I had already watched all the previous movies of the ""Halloween"" franchise I knew what I was about to watch and there was not any surprise. The direction which was made by David Gordon Green followed the same pattern as the previous movies of the franchise without something new. For one more time the interpretation of Jamie Lee Curtis who played as Laurie Strode was very good but she was not as good as in the previous one. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Will Patton's who played as Officer Hawkins, Andi Matichak's who played as Allyson and Judy Greer's who played as Karen. In conclusion, I have to say that ""Halloween Kills"" is an average horror movie comparing with some of the previous movies of the franchise and I do not believe that it adds anything on this.",negative
"3.5 out of 5 stars.Halloween Kills is a pretty fair slasher film that follows right after the last film. When Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) thought she killed Michael Myers. He comes out of the burning house and is back on the killing spree. Tommy (Anthony Michael Hall) bands a community together to help and fight back. To kill Mike Myers once and for all.Halloween Kills is everything you can ask for a slasher film. Different in tone from the first film. This film has more of a bloody and gory body count. While the other movie had more of an intense thrills.What worked? Well Halloween Kills does have a lot more body counts deaths which you can expect for a slasher film. Check mark that off the list. Mike Myers walking in a path and killing anyone he sees. Breaking into peoples homes and slaughtering them. And posing the dead bodies in a disturbing way. Tommy who is a character from the original Halloween movie bands a community to help face the evil. With the help from other survivors from the original movie. This can only help set up a higher body count. Even during the climax of the film which becomes a blood bath.The cast ensemble was decent. Jamie Lee Curtis, Judy Greer, and Andi Matichak are back. Andi Matichak going with her boyfriend and his father to help hunt Myers down. Jamie Lee Curtis spends the whole movie in the hospital and sitting on the sidelines in this sequel for now. While Judy Greer is stuck in the hospital when chaos is breaking loose with people living in fear. And paranoia. Anthony Michael Hall is a new addition playing a previous character was a great addition.The music score by John Carpenter, Cody Carpenter, and Daniel Davies was great and menacing.What did not work? Like all slasher films and characters falling for the whole making stupid decisions and getting killed off. The previous sequel Halloween at least had a smart script which had characters trying to trap Myers. However, Halloween Kills falls for the characters making stupid decision. Everyone setting up for there own trap and getting killed. The script is filled with characters making dumb decisions and slasher horror movie clichés.The plot also felt like a middle chapter with setting up the after math of the movie. While making the community fall into chaos while Myers is back on his killing spree. Not really much is thrown with the plot. The one thing that was interesting with the concept is the theme of essence of evil with Myers about him transcending every time he kills. And his obsession with his old home. Without giving away any details.Halloween Kills is an okay sequel. The script fell into the horror slasher cliché with a thin plot. While setting up for a third film.",positive
"Sir Ridley Scott has stitched together quite a compelling watch here, depicting well, as it does, the rather pyramidical feudal system that provided the legal and cultural structure of life in 14th century Europe. The film centres around allegations made by ""Lady Marguerite"" (Jodie Comer) that during the absence of her war-hero husband ""Sir Jean"" (Matt Damon) she was subjected to the unwanted attentions of powerful squire ""le Gris"" (Adam Driver). By way of a legal presentation to King Charles VI, the narrative now presents us with three equally plausible tales of just how these events may have unfolded. A tale of the initial friendliness between the men and of the ambition, greed, politics and fickleness that led to their current predicament. I cannot say that Damon is particularly good, nor is the blondly coiffured Ben Affleck particularly impressive as their overlord ""Pierre d'Alencon"", but both Driver and Comer offer us strong and characterful performances as each of their stories are rendered to the Court. The different versions are largely the same, there are but subtle and nuanced variations that you might, were you to be on a jury, have to identify and evaluate - in the end there are no forensics, there is no evidence as such - it is all about whom you believe. Again, this makes the film more interesting. It's not just whom you believe, but whom you want to believe, whom you think you ought to believe. There is the powerful church to consider; the local lords - decisions cannot be made according simply to any ""rule of Law"" or ""code of chivalry"". The duel - letting God decide - is the culmination (we see this at the very start of the film before our deliberations begin), but the cleverness of Scott and the writers here is to present us with as near facts as they can - we are left to make our own assessment. We are left to look at the way in which land and people - high born, or otherwise - were pawns in a game knowingly, or otherwise, that frequently became matters of life or death. The photography reminded me a little of the recent ""The King"" (2019) in that the filthy, muddy, damp and rat-infested conditions in which even the grandees lived are presented authentically and that adds loads to the overall feel of the film. The weather being often cold and wet, the battles being fierce and bloody - all of this contributes well to the strong visual imangery. It is a long film, but I found the episodic nature carried that rather well and the last twenty minutes are certainly worth sticking around for.",positive
"Brutality realistic. The Lat Duel is done in three chapter, by the stories of the main characters and the viewer decides the truth. Which I like! Great environmental filming as the viewer experience the smells, feels, and dirt of 13th century France. France is a true socialist state run by the Royals (government) with sword control only royals can own, and the surf society which decides who get represented by a two tier law system. People took by force, and Matt Damon's character is a professional soldier with the perfect 13th century mindset! Damon takes, and wars for possessions including Damon's character's wife! Damon's rival Lane fought with Damon but is a political animal. More educated, personable and useful works in with Affleck, a duke, and moves up the power latter and gains property etc off of Damon's expense. I believe there is a rivalry between the Damon and Lane characters and the rape of Damon's character wife is Lane's characters motive to one up Damon and get away with the crime with connecting with the duke would be able to get away with the rape. Rules do not apply for Lane's class morally or legally! Damon power play for the duel is the only systematic way to get back at Lane and is the warrior which should win the duel. The third chapter is Comer character a women who was sold as property, and meant for breeding. The rape was a property crime with a state run church accusing the victim that if Comer testimony's un true then God will the the victum be burned at the stake if Damon loses. God will let the true man win in the idea of divine providence! Lane is the one who runs the estate and is more educated can read and writes abilities does not matter becasue Damon has all the legal rights; Damon as the warrior makes the decision of the duel. All three Chapter perfectly directed by Scott builds up for the duel, which becomes a savage entertainment. Brutal and realistic 8 stars.",positive
"The penalty for bearing false witness is that you are to be burned alive. Le Gris' Priest (John Kavanagh)Indeed, epic and enjoyable, The Last Duel bears the weight of rape that goes on even today with a woman who challenges a man for violating her against her will. However, this historically accurate medieval occurrence happened 600 years ago under the Normandy reign of the ""mad"" king, Charles VI. In addition, its legal battles are almost as interesting as how a virtuous woman can withstand the pressures of men who rule her and all other women with witless tyranny.Conditions for Marguerite de Carrouges (Jodie Comer) are worse for her in the 14th century because the same ""he said"" ""she said"" is met with the same disbelief as in many cases today. Her uptight husband, Sir Jean (Matt Damon), who rarely smiles, will eventually agree to a duel with his squire, Jacque Le Gris (Adam driver), the accused. It may be the last duel, but it is not the last time a woman comes near death for her allegations.Ridley Scott, who knows something about action (Blade Runner, Gladiator), directs this almost melodrama to a fine degree as he explores, Rashomon-style, three points of view about the rape yet has as memorable a stock dueling scene with horses and lances as any I've seen. The complex drama allows us to question the truth of contradictory elements and to long for a resolution that is unambiguous but eventually hard to attain.The question about justice for women is present as it is today, for in the end the men determine, and women are left helplessly pleading to be treated fairly. That the truth of her allegations rests on the outcome of the duel is absurd but allowed because the King wills it, as if chance could determine the truth more than truth itself.Never does Scott let the action overshadow the search for truth because he allows sharp questioning take place, albeit resting on false assumptions such as if a woman doesn't feel pleasure at the end of the act with her husband, there will be no child, or that a child does not ensue from rape, or that describing a man as handsome predisposes a woman to adultery. Ages ago but a contemporary ignorance our ultra-conservative covens love.Not half as important but more interesting is the turf battle, where land is capriciously given away or gobbled up for debt less than its worth. Women as chattel is not new-doweries exist today even if they are not called that: ""Rape is not a crime against women"" says one man. ""It is a crime of property.""The Last Duel gives the audience almost all the possible pleasures from a motion picture that include gorgeous property and people. Enjoy as it was meant to be seen-in a theater.",positive
"I'm glad I got to see this after interviewing to work at my near by theater well worth it! Jodie Cromer is a riveting actress she has some powerful moments and I really hope The Last Duel gets nominated. Ridley Scott still makes amazing movies decades into his career! The action is incredibly visceral, set design is massive it all felt so authentic and the dialogue was perfect. This movie was meant for the big screen so much of it was cinematic.Sorry for my review but I did love it!",positive
"3.5 out of 5 starsThe Last Duel is a pretty fair historical drama film that has a knight challenging his friend in a duel. Which his friend was accused for raping his wife.It has a beautiful shot cinematography from the direction of Ridley Scott. The plot is moving which builds up to the duel in the climax. Showing the perspectives of Jean (Matt Damon), Jacques (Adam Driver), and Marguerite (Jodie Comer). Strong and powerful plot which involves these characters and a development leading to the duel. Some scenes can be difficult to watch for some.Great performances by Matt Damon, Adam Driver, Ben Affleck, and Jodie Comer.The script does get repetitive which is the down side of the movie. Showing three different perspectives with the three main characters. Seeing the same reenactment of the dramatic events with very little new detail. After seeing the third perspective replaying through the events. It can be a little annoying. Which feels like it is just adding to a long run time as it is. With the movie clocking around 2 and a half hours.The movie does have a couple of brief battle sequences. The duel climax is intense and thrilling. Seeing Jacques and Jean combat each other.It is a pretty decent film that could have been better. It did ran a little too long with its repetitive script. The direction and performances are worth noting.",positive
"His best film since 2007's American Gangster, Ridley Scott's newest two hour plus dramatic epic The Last Duel see's the esteemed British director team up with stars and screenwriters Ben Affleck and Matt Damon (with help on the writing front from fellow filmmaker Nicole Holofcener) to deliver a gripping, confronting and even grueling examination of one of France's most infamous duels of the middle ages that may not appear to be on paper as tension ridden and engaging as it is as a finished product.Those expecting more Kingdom of Heaven, Robin Hood or Gladiator old school Scott may be disappointed by what Duel offers, despite the fact the infrequent battle scenes here are some of the best you've likely seen on the big screen in some time, but as the film breaks away into three distinct acts exploring the version of events that form the crux of this story from the viewpoint of Matt Damon's dedicated knight Jean de Carrouges, Adam Driver's charming but potentially devious squire Jacques Le Gris and Jodie Comer's intelligent but repressed wife Marguerite, Duel becomes one of Scott's most incendiary and challenging films of his long-standing career.Duel takes its time to get its full head of steam in momentum, with viewers likely to find themselves trying hard to wrap their minds around everything going on in the early stages of the film with Scott rushing around through time and locations to get Duel to the place it needs to be to really take hold but once it finds its groove, the brilliant collection of performances (with Ben Affleck a surprising joy also in small amounts of screen-time as the blond haired royal Pierre d'Alençon) and clever way of exploring a life defining moment for all involved and what lead them to the particular instance in time ensuring Duel will have you under its spell right up until a heart pounding and masterfully staged finale.Amongst all the technical prowess and storytelling genius are a number of intriguing sub stories to take note of with Duel offering rising British star Jodie Comer her biggest Hollywood breakthrough yet, with her turn as the charming Marguerite likely to get her attention at the soon to arrive awards season, why the ever impressive Driver is as good as his ever been as the smirking, devilishly charming and detestable Jacques Le Gris.It's a real shame that by the time many would've seen Duel the story that will prevail most prominently about this mature and topical production will be around its noteworthy failings to capture audiences at the box office booths around the world and in a time and place where these type of adult oriented dramas are becoming less common commodities, it's a real shame Scott's best work in decades will have to work hard in the year's to come to find its true worth in audiences minds.Final Say -It's not always easy to watch but The Last Duel is one of the best examples of the medieval drama in some time and with a raft of quality performances and smart filmmaking, Ridley Scott's latest films stands out as one of the best mainstream releases of 2021.4 gloves out of 5.",positive
"Well, to cite Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon may be not the worst idea, but to put the different perspective ""technique"" again in the context of rape/sex smells to me a little like a copycat. Production and acting are good, but the story provided was a little drag for me. Someone remembers, The Duellists (1977)? The movie is about two French officers (again France, again the theme duel!) in the times of Napoleon dueling over many years because one officer felt he was insulted by the other officer on one incidence. That one is in my opinion the stronger movie - you can taste the code of honor and the movie drags you back to those times. For sure not everything is accurate too but it feels like. The Last Duel did not entirely convince me that I watched characters of the 14th century, there are here and there ""glitches"" that just felt wrong. All in all for sure not a bad movie and worth your time, if you are interested in the story, but The Last Duel does not belong to the top movies of Mr. Scott's oeuvre. Just my opinion of course.",negative
"I saw ""The Last Duel"", starring Matt Damon-Deadpool 2, Saving Private Ryan; Adam Driver-the Star Wars movies, Lincoln; Jodie Comer-Free Guy, Star Wars:Episode 9_The Rise of Skywalker and Ben Affleck-Justice League, He's Just Not That Into You.This movie is based on a true story that took place during the medieval times-1300's I think but don't quote me-and is directed by Ridley Scott. Matt plays a Knight and Adam is his squire and they fight together in lots of battles, side by side. Matt falls on hard times financially and decides to marry Jodie, a rich woman. Ben plays a Count, a cousin to King Charles the 6th, that befriends Adam but hates Matt. When Jodie tells Matt that Adam raped her, Matt challenges Adam to a duel-that's how they used to settle their disputes back then-even after Adam claims his innocence. It's a classic case of 'He said, she said'. According to the courts and the King, whoever wins the fight is telling the truth and the dead person is a liar. Also, if Matt looses, Jodie is to be burned at the stake-punishment for her lying. The story is told in 3 chapters, with each chapter telling a person's side of the events that did or did not happen.It's rated ""R"" for strong violence, language and sexual content-including sexual assault & nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 32 minutes.It's not one that I would buy on DVD-once was enough-but it would be a good rental.",negative
"8/10 - if you go in expecting modern dialogue and relatively few action sequences (it's a drama, not an action film), you will find a lot to love in this expertly written and timely story that features strong performances, direction, and set design.",positive
". . . is more of a lamentable shot-for-shot reiteration (of RASHOMON) than was Gus Van Sant's likewise colorized version of another crime classic, PSYCHO (a 1998 rehash). Like Gus with PSYCHO, LAST DUEL producers Matt and Ben apparently figure that they can breathe new life into RASHOMON by simply shooting it in the so-called ""Wonderful World of Color."" And just as colored water did little to make a shower stall more menacing in the PSYCHO reboot, colored garments fail to add any verve to a non-sensual rapacious assault scene during RASHOMON REDUX. Mr. Van Sant proved himself to be no Hitchcock, and Mr. Scott certainly is not Kurosawa, Junior, either.",negative
"Firstly Ridley Scott's talent as a director is undeniable. And it is for the most part well displayed in ""The Last Duel."" Secondly I was pleasantly surprised at Matt Damon's acting chops in the film. I consider Damon a yeoman talent. Certainly not top top tier actor, but a very good one, and he does very vey well in the film. I did not think Adam Driver, who has a stunning range in his career did well in this part. Jodie Comer, after you have seen her in a few roles seems to be repetitive and I was not impressed with her portrayal of her role in Duel.But my main impression is that aside from a number of really dramatic action sequences, the narrative inappropriately tries to impose modern mores. This just doesn't work. It is a jarring anachronism given this is set in late medieval, pre-Enlightenment times. Similar to the problem in the narrative in ""Kingdom of Heaven"" were historians critiqued the narrative element of having the lead characters on both sides displaying modern and thus utterly artificial views of tolerance that were manifestly not present in anyone at the time the piece was set. With Dual and Kingdom one gets the feeling of a fourth wall-like didactic lecture to audience.Lastly to those who say noting the similarity with Rashomon is wrong, OI can only say you havent seen Rashomon. The Last Duel has been called "" ""Rashomon crossed with #MeToo"" and ""Ridly Scott's Rashomon.""I saw this Athens Film Festival while in Greece on business. 6/10.",positive
"The way it tells it's story doesn't always work but The Last Duel is still an incredible historical drama that's intense, relevant and extremely harrowing and definitely one of Ridley Scott's best films.Jodie Comer is phenomenal in the standout performance of the film. Matt Damon and Adam Driver are both reliably incredible and Ben Affleck is a definite scene stealer and really funny.Ridley Scott's direction is excellent, it's extremely well filmed with a superb fight in the third act that's easily one of his best. The visual effects are extremely impressive and the music by Harry Gregson-Williams is fantastic.",positive
"A $100 million epic that probably should have been made for significantly less considering the subject matter, Ridley Scott's The Last Duel is a hard-edged Rashomon-like look at a rape in Medieval France and the ensuing legal duel, sanctioned by Charles VI, the last in France's history. I'm going to be honest, I'm not surprised that it's bombing horribly at the box office. This isn't the sort of thing people want to buy popcorn to and go to the theaters to watch. It's too heavy.The film is broken up into three chapters, each telling the story up to a certain point from the perspective of the three main characters. The first is centered around Jean de Carrouges (Matt Damon), a squire who led a hasty charge on an enemy line in battle that cost his lord, the Count Pierre d'Alencon (Ben Affleck), a key city. Alongside him in battle was Jacques Le Gris (Adam Driver) who helped Jean avoid death in battle and is also a squire under Pierre. The friendship between Jean and Jacques quickly devolves into a rivalry as Jacques gets closer to the Count, receiving more gifts for loyal service than Jean. Jean, meanwhile, meets the daughter of a pardoned traitor, Marguerite (Jodie Comer). Jean negotiates with her father for her dowery, agreeing upon a particular plot of land that gets snatched from him when Jacques, unknowing the pending engagement of Jean and Marguerite, agrees to accept that land for the rents that Marguerite's father owes Pierre, essentially (but not literally) stealing the land from Jean. Lawsuits are filed, egos are bruised, and Jean becomes increasingly bitter as he sees his lot in life lowered while Jacques seems to raise his own lots through no effort of his own.Before going any further, I want to admire the film's structure. The first third, Jean de Carrouges' telling, is where we get the bulk of the world building, and it's important stuff for the story. It's not just about women being pawns in the games of powerful men. There's a lot of detail about how the feudal system in France worked. How squires reported to Counts who reported to Kings, about how lawsuits worked, and how finances worked. Everyone is always short of cash, and the only way Jean de Carrouges can get out is to go to war from plunder and prisoners to sell at ransom. He goes to war in Scotland for just this, returning with nothing, and needing to immediately go to Paris to receive payment from the crown for his efforts. When he comes home, Marguerite tells him that Jacques Le Gris showed up when she was alone and raped her. Jean believes her, and he pursues a course of action that leads to the King of France endorsing the legal duel.The second section is Jacques Le Gris'. Where Jean's section showed a man perennially beaten down, Le Gris' shows a man of education and loose morals climbing the ladder of power easily. Much of his section takes place in Pierre's presence as he plays witty word games and joins Pierre in sex games with the pretty young women in Pierre's court (outside of Pierre's wife's presence, of course). He's also good with numbers and takes up Pierre's accounts, agreeing to make sense of the books but also go to the different tenants on Pierre's lands to pick up the missing rents. It's here, in Le Gris' section where we see that there are subtle but very interesting things happen. There's one particular moment that is in all three sections where Jean de Carrouges and Jacques Le Gris attempt to reconcile at the celebration of another squire's new child. In all three, a single line is uttered by different people about how no fight between squires should be allowed to continue for it is ruinous to all. In Jean's he speaks it, in Jacques' he speaks it, and in Marguerite's the other squire speaks it off camera. This is like the memories of the three reflecting back on the events from the end of the movie, wondering how they all got there.The most important aspect of this difference is in the rape itself. Jacques loves (lusts after?) Marguerite, but it's mostly from afar. After a brief exchange at the celebration where both are revealed as book learned and witty, they spy each other in different places over the next few months. When Jacques sees Jean after Jean returns from Scotland on his way to Paris, Jacques decides that this brute of a man has left behind his beautiful, intelligent lady of a wife behind at home alone. He visits, enters her home through deception, and gets into her bedroom with her and no one else in the house. What follows is a recreation of an earlier scene from Pierre's bedroom where Jacques had chased another lady around a table in a game that led to consensual sex. You can see the mirror, but at the same time it's obvious that Marguerite doesn't want to participate. It's not playful, but it's definitely not consensual. However, from Jacques' point of view you can see how he might see it that way. As he explains to Pierre later, when the accusations are running around the country, Marguerite was a lady who just put up the normal objections, like the lady from the earlier scene.The final third is Marguerite's point of view, and it provides more interesting context around both men. Her first scene is of Jean angrily arguing with her father about the loss in dowery with her father promising him that Marguerite will be fertile. The celebration scene clarifies a moment where she was dancing with Jean but looking at Jacques with her dialogue explaining about fake smiles getting people places rather than anger. There are scenes with Jean's mother, and the two really don't like each other. There are scenes of her sex with Jean which obviously pains her (the common belief at the time that women require ""the little death"", an orgasm, in order to conceive is mentioned by her doctor in reference to how she can't conceive). And, most importantly, there is the rape, which is a good bit more horrible from her perspective. We can see that Jacques was thinking that he was playful, but he's also far rougher with her and her protestations far more vocal. Also, Jean's reaction to the news if far less understanding that Jean's memory.It all ends up with that titular duel, and Ridley Scott puts his trademarked look on the brutal fight that earns every bit of the R-rating. It is both satisfying in some ways and really empty in others, on purpose. Neither Jean nor Jacques are particularly good people. Even in their own tellings they're not really admirable at all. Jean is a thin-skinned and impulsive brute who got himself laughed out of court, and Jacques is a cruel womanizer. When one side wins, it's not the pure victory anyone really wants because motives, purposes, and intentions are all crossed and confused.No, this really isn't something that was going to make its money back at the box office.I loved it, though. It's a complex portrait of a brutal time filled with very good performances from everyone especially Jodie Comer as Marguerite and Ridley Scott's wonderful visual sense of grandeur. I would never have greenlit this movie with a $100 million budget (and a script that is rumored to be at least an hour longer than the final product) as a producer, but I'm glad it's here. It's a hard film, but I think it's ultimately very worthwhile.",positive
"LIKES:The Setting: For reviewers and audience members like me, being pulled into a world makes the experience, and the Last Duel has accomplished this very well. Like Game Of Thrones, the studio has pulled us into the time of the European conquests, where countries and lands switched alliances in the name of greed, power, and entitlement that we've seen time and time again. Misty forests, and wide fields culminate in the feeling of vastness of the world prior to modernization, as one traveled between havens of castles and forts for celebrations. Within these walls, the dark and hallowed halls are authentic, creating these immense fortresses that hold much with the walls and courtyards. All the subtle nuances of lighting via flickering flame, the echoes of the halls, and the details of changing certain room to please the owner's needs are here, and you really feel pulled back in time.The Cinematography: It's beautiful to say the least, with great use of lighting and filters to bring about the moods of each scene. Battle scenes are engaging and ever changing to really draw you into the fight, with many angles capture at just the right approach to really draw out the emotions of the scene. Meanwhile, the more dramatic moments find blend plenty of dynamics together to draw out the scenes and give you the full emotions of that moment and the stakes that they hold. The fervor of the scribe who is being abused, or the pain of the person as they are berated for their thoughts are all beautifully stacked and layered from the camera work and really get you into this dramatic tale.Dialogue: It's a movie that holds a lot of talking and character development, meaning that the words need to evolve past the common dialogue found on social media and comedy films. The Last Duel has some amazing words lining the page, using the poetic descriptions famous for these time period pieces that blend metaphor and ""common"" tongue into a fluid ballad of deeper tones. It paints the pictures of the feelings of all those involved, being used as a weapon to cut deep into the pride and ""honor"" of characters who hold those qualities close to heart. The deep dialogue is certainly a meat of the movie that you will either hate or love, but for me, this film does not get so lost in the dialogue to have you scratching your head like reading Shakespeare in high school.The Story Telling: This dark tale stands out from other drams, due to the presentation of what is a common tale in this day and age. It's not just because it occurs in the Medieval time period, but more so in the way Scott and his team told the tale in the chapter approach. Each of the chapters in the Last Duel comes from the perspective of the person involved in the act, with the same tale being told, but getting those added nuances and beliefs by the storyteller about what they believed occurred. Seeing those subtle differences and getting to see their actions during the time period was a genius move that does not rub stuff in your face, and ending at the same point helped build up to the titular duel to come.The Action: Believe it or not, this movie does have action outside of the trailer's fight and at times it is rather impressive. Scott and his team give you representative battles of the time period, combining swarm moments with personalized action, to combine into a fight that had some character behind it. A little violent sure, but Scott's handling of these moments gave use enough break from the drama to wake up, but never detracting too much to lose grip of the story. When the final sequence occurs, Scott extends the chaos of the battlefield into one duel, and it is a splendid dance of word and blade that last about 16 minutes by my watch. It holds the spirt of the entire movie and puts a fitting and exciting conclusion that has you wondering who will stand and who will fall, unless you know history.The Acting: Hands down, this highly character centered piece requires good acting and this may be the strongest piece of the film. Damon is a wonderful opening chapter for the film, and his time as a squire is filled with moments of hurt, betrayal, and fury that he plays so well. Similar to other roles I have seen him in, that control of letting the emotions out in the right amount at the right time cannot be understated for me in this film. His engagement in the facets of the knightlihood actions, and how he processes all the pressure of the time are incredible and I loved how much he was pulled into the film to challenge that dynamic. Adam Driver, well the man continues to blow my mind with how elegant his skills can deliver on a character. More aristocratic in nature, Driver brings more of the poetry and nobility language that paints a rivalry between the two nights. His delivery of the language is much tighter than Damon's, and his outrage is more focused to again show the approaches to the lifestyle of the time periods. Ben Affleck does very well with his role as the arrogant Lord of the Land, his delivery holds more of the nobility debauchery and corruption of the land, but works well with his sinful delivery of the dialogue. The champion though, was the Jodie Comer, who once again delivered a role I enjoyed despite the harder scenes to watch. Comer holds so much elegance as a noble lady, only to then see her spirit come out during her side of the tale in the actions she did for her estate. When the emotional moments came up, she stacked her emotions to gradually pour out, from hurt betrayal to full on hysterics depending on the scene. She was elegant in her delivery, yet new when to lose that elegance to make a point and that control and depth, alongside the darker moments she had to bear, continues to display the talent and promise she has.DISLIKES:The Pacing: I agree with my fellow reviewers that the movie loses its stride as the first hour fades, becoming a bit of an uneven mess that loses the power of the first act. A strong opening act starts to wind down int eh second and the third, and its only the promise of the duel and the outcome that gets you to stay. This uneven pace mixed with the longer run time, can make it difficult and if you don't have the energy, the quieter moments can lead you to falling asleep, but if you can make it to the end you'll be rewarded.The Animal cruelty: The Last Duel does not venture into the territory of unnecessary torture of animals, but it does have some graphic displays that were painful for me to watch. I'm not a fan of seeing graphic shots of animals suffering or their corpses, so I can't say this was my favorite aspect. Yes, it's realistic and keeps in theme with the rest of the film, but for people like me, it can be a little somber to watch.The Sexual Moments: Yeah, if you've read my reviews, the sexual moments are already not as enjoyable for me to watch if they offer little to the story. While the debauchery does show the characters of some of our casts and how one entertained oneself in old times, much of it got a little too visual for me. Seeing lots of the acts in the manner we see can be a bit hard to watch as well, especially seeing the more aggressive and illegal acts unfold that can be hard for those with PTSD. Applaude to the actors for making it come to life, but I'm still not the biggest fan of seeing forced love making multiple times when I get the picture the first time.The Presentation: Ironically, as much as I love the three perspectives, I can't say that it did not have it's own weaknesses with the presentation. The three acts will give you the perspectives of all three and allow one to appreciate how stories fluctuate depending on the mind of the teller. However, seeing many of the same scenes again and again starts to lose the fervor and become boring given how little is added. Fortunately, there are other scenes happening around the moment that help relieve the boredom, but still seeing many of the same scenes occur with little action moments to again break up the drama was not the best choice for me and a more linear tale would have escaped this flaw.The VERDICT: The Last Duel is a splendid example of cinematography storytelling for a very sensitive subject. Ridley Scott immerses you into the setting with visuals, clothing, and setting that will haul your butt into the Medieval time period and settle you into the politics of the movie and the subject matter. Fantastic writing feels authentic to the world of yore, and enriches the dramatic moments with a life that would otherwise be a bit dull, while action scenes contain all the splendid details to drop you into the carnage the world once faced. Yet the acting alongside the presentation are the solid points for the movie, with a cast who really does make such a dark subject tolerable and engaging, while also illustrating the flaws vanity can bring and how there are multiple sides of the story. Yet, the movie is not for those who get constant excitement in their films, as the pacing is off after about the first hour, which for a 2.5 hour movie is saying something. Mix in the darker elements that can be a bit much at times, alongside needing some action to break up the monotony of the film. And while the presentation is unique and artistic, it also is a big limitation because of how bland the same scenes become when little is added to them. Overall, the movie scores a worthy of theater vibe for me and I recommend a watch if you get the time.My scores are: Action/Drama/History: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.5.",positive
"The Last Duel's got everything: marquee talent behind and in front of the camera, sweeping scope to match and swordplay you'd expect to see in the best episodes of Game of Thrones. Yet Disney decided to give this movie next to no promotion at all in spite of Ridley Scott's robust reputation in Hollywood.The Last Duel's got equal parts good and weird elements in its runtime: the action's genuinely fantastic and Adam Driver is sensational, though Matt Damon's accent is outright broken as is Ben Affleck's blonde hair and make-up (I'm sorry, but seeing Batman with that haircut and a goatee-like beard in 14th Century France is pretty damn weird). Aside from the weird stuff, you still genuinely feel like you're in France during that grittier period in time, and the chaptered storytelling structure helps the film feel less overwhelming for people unfamiliar with French history.The Last Duel feels like it's amongst the last in a dying breed of cinema: historical epics with hefty budgets up against other blockbusters to match; which is a damn shame because it didn't have to be this way. This deserved better treatment from a marketing standpoint and didn't deserve to underperform the way it did. Pandemic or no pandemic there could have been an other way.Anyway, this film is a treat, if at times somewhat unusual because of Matt Damon's and Ben Affleck's odd character quirks in front of the camera. 4/5 stars.",positive
"Adam Driver tries to break up the incredibly intense lifelong relationship between Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. Jodie Comer has a big story to tell about violation by the talking horse she met in the barn. The King is upset, the court jesters are gossipping. Lots of discussions, court intrigue, and blah, blah, blah. Eventually there is one action scene, which is seen in all the trailers for this movie, and that is a wrap.",negative
"Ridley Scott's latest is a historical drama based on true story set in 14th Century France. Two warriors, Carrouges (Matt Damon) and Le Gris (Adam Driver), become friends on the battlefield but over the years their relationship devolves into a rivalry. Carrouges marries Marguerite (Jodie Comer) and she too becomes entangled in the soldiers' feud when an assault charge is levied.The screenplay by Nicole Holofcener, Damon & Matt Damon is more precisely based on Eric Jager's book about the title incident. The script is broken up into a classic Rashomon situation with the movie having three distinct chapters, each told from the three principals' point of view. This basic structure has been used many times since the Kurosawa classic and it's a sturdy one even its applied here in a bit too orderly a fashion.Many of the events are recounted three times and too often they are differentiated only slightly - three times. It does cut against the flow of the movie. Scott is too formal a filmmaker and isn't able to transcend the strictures of the screenplay and give the story-telling a more deft and flexible treatment. It's all by the book, and the filmmakers certainly put their collective thumb on the scale as to which version is indeed ""the truth"". Fortunately, the acting is quite good, and the main trio are able to give each rendering some shading. Affleck has the most fun as the flamboyant Count Pierre who takes Le Gris under his wing. Harriet Walter is a bit too brittle as Carrouges mother and her accent is even more noticeably variable than the others in the main cast (all the actors speak English with a slight continental twang). Acting honors go to Comer who has to traverse being ""just a woman"" in the two men's chapters while becoming the centerpiece of Marguerite's.THE LAST DUEL is a well-crafted production and the fairly sparse action scenes are handled with aplomb. The finale is particularly vivid. Scott's craftsmanship is certainly at the forefront even if he can never quite elevate the workmanlike screenplay. It's a solid movie, but a little more artistry could have brought it up a notch or two.",positive
"The Last Duel tells the story of Sir Jean de Carrouges(Matt Damon) & his wife, Marguerite de Carrouges(Jodie Comer). When an unspeakable crime is committed against the Carrouges by Jean's aide Jacques Le Gris(Adam Driver), King Charles VI(Alex Lawther) tells Carrouges & Le Gris to settle their differences by taking part in a trial by combat.The Last Duel is a jaw-dropping film. Director Ridley Scott has given us an unforgettable movie, that will lead to long discussions about the bygone early centuries when kings ruled the land, long after the credits roll. The long wait for the next screenwriting collaboration between Matt Damon & Ben Affleck after Good Will Hunting(1997), along with the excellent assistance of Nicole Holofcener, has definitely been worth it. The action set pieces are mind-blowing with a shock & surprise factor that's just not present in most action films, these days. In the middle act, the movie does drag a tiny bit. However, what follows immediately after, makes up for this & then some! The titular duel is definitely the highlight of the film. Matt Damon is amazing as Sir Jean de Carrouges. Adam Driver is outstanding as Jacques Le Gris. Jodie Comer is the star of the show as Marguerite de Carrouges. Comer deserves an Oscar nomination for her spectacular performance. Harriet Walter is great as Nicole de Carrouges. Ben Affleck is unforgettable as Pierre d'Alencon. Alex Lawther is awesome as King Charles VI. The supporting cast is impressive. The Last Duel is a must watch for all action movie buffs. Watch it on the biggest screen possible & leave the theater, absolutely gobsmacked!",positive
"With films such as GLADIATOR, KINGDOM OF HEAVEN, ROBIN HOOD, EXODUS: GODS AND MONSTERS and the current THE LAST DUEL, Director Ridley Scott is single-handedly trying to keep alive the ""Sword and Sandals"" genre that was so much en vogue in the Golden Age of Hollywood.However, he'll have to do better than THE LAST DUEL to keep the genre going.Starring Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Adam Driver and Jodi Comer, THE LAST DUEL tells the tale of the...well...Last Duel in France in the 1300's. The story tells the tale of 2 noblemen, their ups & downs and the accusation of the wife of one of them that the other raped her. The only way to solve the dispute is a duel to the death.Following the format of such films as RASHOMON (1950) and, more recently, WRATH OF MAN (2021), THE LAST DUEL is told in 4 parts - telling the same story from different perspectives. But, unlike RASHOMON and (surprisingly) WRATH OF MAN which peeled the onion back during each different telling, adding a deeper and richer layer to the story each time, THE LAST DUEL pretty much tells the same story over and over, not really telling it differently and not really adding any layers to the story. You pretty much know before THE LAST DUEL who is innocent, who is guilty and how the duel is going to play out.So, Director Scott will need to rely on the performances and the look and feel of the film to get the audience hooked and intrigued during this 2 hour and 32 minute epic, but the script (by Nicole Holofcener, Affleck & Damon just isn't up to the task.The acting is...fine. Driver fares the best out of the 4 leads - probably because he is the actor most suited for this type of film than the others. Comer's part is underwritten and she has surprisingly little to do - which brings us to Affleck and Damon. Affleck has the showier role and provides a spark of interest in his limited time on the screen while Damon is dour and serious and trudges through the film - as does the audience.Director Scott (ALIEN) brings professionalism to the proceedings and accurately depicts the look and feel of the time and stages the duel (and battle scenes) with a trained eye, but the characters/performances did not leave me with anyone to truly root for (or care about) and by the time we got to THE LAST DUEL, I just wanted it to be over.Letter Grade: B-6 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",negative
"In Ridley Scott's new movie ""The Last Duel"" we are in the late 14th century in France. And - apart from in one scene - it appears to be perpetual winter!Positives: It's an intriguing script - the first collaboration between Damon and Affleck since their Oscar-winning ""Good Will Hunting"" from 25 years ago. It presents 3 different versions of ""the truth"" from three different perspectives. (One of these - Marguerite's version - is suggested as being the 'actual' truth through a clever delayed fade of the chapter title). Many of the same scenes are repeated in each variant: sometimes with obvious differences in fact; sometimes with the slightest nuance of tone or expression; and sometimes with no change to the visuals, but with the benefit of hearing the dialogue being spoken. Very clever.""Killing Eve""'s Jodie Comer is just brilliant here. She is the master of nuanced expression, and she genuinely deserves an Oscar nomination for this work. Combined with her great and fun role in the surprise summer hit ""Free Guy"", Comer is surely on a path to movie acting greatness.Damon, Driver and Affleck also have great fun with their roles: they are all eminently watchable and this is a study in acting greatness. But I particularly loved Alex Lawther's turn as the king: all excitable childish power in the body of a young adult.Battle scenes and the final duel are delivered in visceral nature reminiscent of Ridley Scott's famous battle and arena scenes in ""Gladiator"".Excellent production design and special effects on show here. Another Oscar nomination perhaps? The movie was filmed in the Dordogne region of France and also - after a 2020 Covid lockdown - in Ireland.Negatives: At two and a half hours it's another long film (is October 2021 designated long film month??). And although the nuances between the different versions of reality are fascinating, there's a degree of tedium involved in rehashing the same scenes (in some cases) for the third time. Arguably I think a few of these re-versions could have been omitted to reduce the bladder-testing run time.Summary Thoughts on ""The Last Duel"": This is Ridley Scott back on top form again. I found this a gripping watch. As the film opens, we are teased with the start of the 'boss level' duel between Damon and Driver. But these final dramatic scenes are the emotional lynchpin of the movie since only then do you understand the background and the ramifications of the fight. Evidently, 14th Century France was NOT a great time for sexual equality. Women were merely chattels, denied not only fair play and self-determination, but also the bedroom niceties of foreplay and, in most cases, orgasms. As the story was based on real events, the courage and determination of Marguerite of Carrouges were extraordinary. And Jodie Comer's portrayal of her wonderfully demonstrates, yet again, why she is the UK's most exciting acting export for many years.(For the full graphical review and video version, please search for #onemannsmovies on the web.)",positive
"Oh it's Mr. Steal yo girlBased on a true story, the movie told the event that led to the duel between a knight and a squire whose friendship turned ugly.The cast of this movie alone excited me. We got Jason Bourne, Kylo Ren, and Batman. And they were all solid in their roles.However, I had a major problem with the storytelling. The plot was told in 3 separate chapters with each from a character's perspective. This was meant to fill in the blank and reveal major twists to the story. The problem is that the story itself was too simple for this style of storytelling to work. Chapter 1 and 2 were enough for me to comprehend the whole story and had good understanding of the characters. Many scenes were repeated in the same way without any unique look from the characters. This led to the runtime feeling too stretched out. I think 30 minutes could be cut off and the story would still be coherent.I would have been entirely bored of the movie if not for the duel itself. That duel was the only unpredictable part of the story, and Matt Damon and Adam Driver (or their stunt double idk) performed the fight very well. There was good amount of blood and intensity to made me excited.Overall, despite the great concluding duel, the storytelling made for a disappointing movie. 6/10.",negative
"My Review - ""The Last Duel""My Rating 8.5 Ridley Scott Producer/Director of many fine movies like Gladiator, The Martian, Blade Runner, and Thelma and Louise hasn't lost his touch with this fine film .He is now 83 years old and has another much awaited film due out later this year ""The House of Gucci."" starring Adam Driver who also stars in ""The Last Duel"" .Adam Driver is certainly on fire at the Box Office these days in great demand.Ridley Scott is one of those fine Directors like Alfred Hitchcock, Pedro Almodovar, Quentin Tarantino, Stanley Kubrick ,Jane Campion, Frederico Fellini and many more who have given us great film entertainment but never won an Academy Award?I think ""The Last Duel"" is one of his finest films with a Screenplay co written by Matt Damon, Ben Affleck and Nicole Holofcener based on the novels by Eric Jäger.The Last Duel set in France 1386 is a cinematic and thought-provoking drama set in the midst of the Hundred Years War that explores the ubiquitous power of men, the frailty of justice and the strength and courage of one woman willing to stand alone in the service of truth. Based on actual events, the film unravels long-held assumptions about France's last sanctioned duel between Jean de Carrouges and Jacques Le Gris, two friends turned bitter rivals. Carrouges is a respected knight known for his bravery and skill on the battlefield.Matt Damon plays Sir Jean de Carrouges who challenges Jacques Le Gris , Adam Driver to a duel to the death after his wife Marguerite magnificently played by Jodie Comer accuses Le Gris of rape while her husband is away fighting in Scotland.As usual no spoilers from me this is a film in 3 Chapters seen from 3 different perspectives first the husband's , then the accused and finally the wife's which we are told is the Truth.The author of the book Ben Jager counts the film as ""at least 75 percent historically accurate, maybe more,"" noting that while evidence may not exist for specific moments, there is a general record that supports the re creation.I read that Matt Damon said that he and Ben Affleck brought on Nicole Holofcener to help them write the female perspectives of the screenplay and I think that's very obvious as it's a fine script .I can't think of a period Drama film that reflects contemporary issues and attitudes as successfully as ""The Last Duel ."" Co Screenplay writer Ben Affleck made this observation recently about the film he commented ""Schools educate you, and religious services deliver sermons, and movies - at their best - can generate empathy and generate compassion,"" says Affleck. ""There is this paradox of the human experience where oftentimes different people come away from the same situation with different impressions of that. And yet there can only be one truth. We wanted to examine that. But we wanted to do it through the lens of this situation.""So it wasn't so much about hewing fastidiously to historical truth, because that wouldn't have served the narrative needs we were as interested in, as much as illuminating the fact that the vestiges of the sexism and misogyny of the patriarchy we live with now come from a place that was Western civilization's codified value system."" There's some fine performances in this movie especially from Jodie Comer as Marguerite we saw her recently in the 2017 series playing Elizabeth of York she is equally brilliant in period drama or contemporary roles like her wonderfully evil psychotic character Villanelle in Killing Eve Jodie Comer is a wonderful actress.The other standout performance for me is Adam Driver as the accused Jacques Le Gris I'm so glad he came on board and that Ben Affleck who was originally cast to play his role stepped aside to play the lesser role of Pierre d Álencon the foppish Count . It was the right choice as Adam Driver has the intensity and dark mood that's so effective for this role.Both Matt Damon and Ben Affleck give good performances Ben Affleck looks a little odd as a fair blonde bearded character it took me a while to recognise him.Matt Damon looks so scarred and weather beaten which is appropriate for his role .Apparently Matt Damon can't grow facial hair, so the makeup department had to try out 20 different beards to apply to Matt Damon's face. He reportedly got a skin rash underneath the stuck-on beard, which was so irritating that he had to be treated with ice packs after every scene, while shooting the movie.Filming began on February 14, 2020 in Dordogne, France and continued until March 12, 2020 in the medieval castle of Berzé-le-Châtel (near Mâcon), Burgundy, France.On March 13, 2020, production of this film was halted due to the Coronavirus pandemic. Before that, filming in France was finished, and the production had moved to Ireland. Ridley Scott had already filmed for four weeks, and had one hour of the movie completed during this time, the filming only concluded production in October last year.This is definitely a film to be seen in a Cinema don't wait till the end of its 40 day theatrical release when it goes to Streaming .Like many movies affected by slow audience return to Cinemas this is a film thats had a disastrous Box Office return so far with a return only of $ 9.9 million The film cost north of $100 million to make it deserves to be seen and seen in a Cinema.",positive
"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free thoughts, please follow my blog to read my full review :)""The Last Duel became one of my favorite Ridley Scott films, boasting a commanding Jodie Comer who delivers one of the year's most emotionally powerful performances.Adam Driver, Matt Damon, and Ben Affleck all offer remarkable interpretations, but the actress fully embodies Marguerite de Carrouges' courage amid so much pain and suffering in a theme-heavy, brutally shocking true story.The perspective-based narrative structure is interesting and efficient enough to overcome its inevitable repeatability issues. Holding technical attributes that will surely get recognition in the awards season - especially Harry Gregson-Williams' score - the actual duel is one of the most nerve-wracking sequences of the last few years, compensating the audience's patience with a satisfying climax.Watch it on the big screen, if possible.""Rating: A-",positive
"Just saw ""The Last Duel"", a historical drama film based on the non-fiction book ""The Last Duel: A True Story of Trial by Combat in Medieval France"" by Eric Jager. Directed by Ridley Scott (""Alien"", ""Blade Runner"", ""Gladiator"") and starring Matt Damon, Adam Driver, Jodie Comer, and Ben Affleck, it revels in the grandiose spectacle of the time period while offering some reflective commentary on attitudes towards victim shaming.In 1386, knight Jean de Carrouges (Matt Damon) returns to France after a victorious battle against the Scottish army. Upon arriving home, Jean's wife Marguerite (Jodie Comer) informs him that while he was gone, his best friend Jacques Le Gris (Adam Driver) forced himself into their home and brutally raped her. Jean takes this matter to the magistrate Pierre d'Alencon (Ben Affleck), but due to him being a close associate of Jacques, no charges end up being pressed. With no other option left, Jean challenges Jacques to a duel after receiving approval from the King and wishing to prove himself, Jacques accepts.Films set during medieval times aren't really something I find myself gravitating towards. This isn't due to me not being interested in that particular setting but rather because I think there's an oversaturation of media taking place in that era (I blame this on the overwhelming popularity of ""Game of Thrones"" during its heyday). What I think helped ""The Last Duel"" rise above the typical medieval tropes that have been done to death was how it addresses some uncanny parallels to relatable modern day issues that audiences can identify with.The catalytic plot device that sets things in motion is Jacques' sexual assault of Marguerite and the aftermath of her accusations against him. Due to the time period and her social status, Marguerite's pleas for justice are mostly met with ridicule from the general public. This is similar to what happens today with real assault victims whose allegations are called into question because of the abundance of those discovered to be crying wolf. Of course, Marguerite is telling the truth but naturally others find it hard to believe her. I never would have expected this type of movie to address these matters in such a concise, reasonable way, yet it manages to do so without seeming like it's picking sides. It shows that issues like this have been problematic throughout history and likely always will be with how things are currently going.Structurally, the film is divided into three chapters - Jean's story, Jacques' story, and Marguerite's story, culminating with a lead up to the titular duel. As a result, certain events play out from each of the character's different perspectives to show how the three of them all give biased accounts of what happens throughout the story. A technique like this is highly reminiscent of Akira Kurosawa's 1950 film ""Rashomon"", which told alternate versions of the same basic story, forcing the audience to make their own judgement of what really occurred. A common misconception is that there are always two sides to every story but in actuality there are three - yours, theirs, and the truth. Because of the personal bias that comes from someone's unique view of the world, it is impossible to ascertain the exact way events played out, so by offering fragmented parts of the truth, the film cleverly allows us to make up our own minds.Coming from a director like Ridley Scott, you can expect him to spare no expense when it comes to the film's visual style. He immerses us in 14th century France with breathtaking shots of large medieval castles towering over the land with a watchful eye on the peasants below. Huge crowds are seen congregating around the battle arena waiting for Jean and Jacques to fight each other to the death, which is reminiscent of Scott's 2000 film ""Gladiator"". All of this combined with careful pacing and editing helps the 153 minute long film feel much shorter than it is. While Scott's films have been very hit-and-miss lately, I would consider ""The Last Duel"" to be one of his hits, providing a solid mix of medieval action and genuine human drama. Interestingly, Scott's directorial debut was a 1977 movie called ""The Duellists"" which also featured duelling as its main plot element.It's no easy task to focus a film around the viewpoints of three different characters but with lead actors as well cast as Matt Damon, Adam Driver, and Jodie Comer, it works fine. Damon's character Jean is appropriately hot-headed and temperamental in the way he handles any situation, whether he's battling against vast armies or defending the honour of his wife. Although he is usually the morally superior one, his bad attitude prevents him from becoming the true hero of the story. Adam Driver plays Jacques as the jealous best friend, coveting Marguerite with a sense of entitlement born out of him frequently rubbing shoulders with French royalty. Unfortunately, we only see a few minutes of the two interacting favourably before the remainder of the film focuses around their mutual resentment. I just wish the film had shown more of Jean and Jacques' friendship before their falling out as it would have added more emotional weight to their inevitable duel. Despite being the lesser known of the acting trio, Jodie Comer holds her own alongside Damon and Driver, portraying Marguerite as a genuine victim of assault who remains strong in the face of the non-believers. She's the closest thing to a hero in this film, although that's not really saying much.Although ""The Last Duel"" may not be viewed as a classic Ridley Scott film years from now, it will certainly be remembered as one of his strongest efforts. The man always works hard to make his films look as authentic as possible to transport his audience into the world he has helped bring to life. Since Scott is considered to be the ""father of the director's cut"" (e.g. ""Blade Runner"", ""Alien"", ""Kingdom of Heaven""), I'm curious to know if there will ever one released for this film. This may be wishful thinking right now but it wouldn't be too far out of the realms of possibility.I rate it 8/10.",positive
"I liked it. Its not what you would expect form the trailer or Ridley Scott, its more Rashomon than Gladiator. So I ssume a lot of people might be disappointed by being mislead.But its a good story, very up to date and relevant. The film reunites Matt Damon and Ben Affleck as writers the first time since Good Will Hunting, and just as in Good Will Hunting they also share the screen, with Damon having the more prominent role but with Affleck having a stand-out as well.The screenplay is cleverly written, with ""old fashioned"" dialogues mixed with modern words, behavoir and reacitons. It was an intersting mix and quite surreal at times.Acting wise it was solid. Matt Damon was all right. Not his best performance, not his worst. I guess he just got overshadowed by some of his co-stars. Most prominently Jodie Comer who gave hell of a performance. I think this will be her final breakthrough on the silver screen and I wouldnt be surprised if she makes some appearance in this years award season. Really a fantastic performance with many facettes. I also liked Adam Driver quite a lot. His character was nicely developed and he added a lot to it. Another good performance on his resume. Last but not least you have blonde Ben Affleck. Blonde Affleck is a bit irritating and very cartoonish at first but once you get used to it you realize the sarcasm that lies his in his performance - kind of reminds me on his turn in Shakespear in Love.The score is good, the cinematography amazing. The editing seems off at first but in the essence makes a lot of sense. Good directionl effort by Ridely Scott who was for once more intersted in the story than monumental fight scenes.Really loved the last 10 minutes.",positive
"Denis Villeneuve directs this remake of the Frank Herbert classic sci-fi. It's the first part of two movies. Timothée Chalamet is the lead as Paul Atreides. The emperor has given his family the desert planet Arrakis where the most important spice is mined. It's a trap and everyone knows it.I've never read the book. I have seen the David Lynch version and the Sci Fi movies. I do miss some of the Lynchian weirdness. This version feels more Earth-bound without the weirdness. Arrakis has a lot more middle eastern influences. House Atreides is more Scottish. I do wish that they get rid of the damn bagpipes. One hopes that they would get rid of that noise in a few thousand years. As for Chalamet, he is the perfect prettiness for the role. He looks too pretty to be believed as a fighter which is exactly what every other character comments on about him. He has the ethereal look of an angelic hero in an ancient classical Greek story. I'm not sure if newbies could get lost in this labyrinthian world. It's not really that complicated. I think Villeneuve has made the right movie. He puts his skills into the epic feel of this franchise. It feels right... coming from a non-book-reader.",positive
"Having read the book a hundred years ago, it took some time to begin to understand what was going on. If there is a criticism that many share, it is the pacing of the first part of the film. It needed something to set the scene for us, to show us who the strong and the weak were. I'm not much for narration (show me, don't tell me), but it may not have been a bad idea. The scenes are magnificent with special effects off the chart. Many desert travel scenes are quite endless. How do you spruce up a desert. I thought the sand worms were a little one dimensional. I know there is another film down the road.",positive
"It is not a simple film. But an adaptation of one of real difficult to adapt at his standards novel. And, honestly, this Dune: Part One is just seductive at visual level. But, I admitt, I am far to be very enthusiastic about it. Maybe, I am to attached to old adaptations - first 2000 one - , maybe I feel the novel in different way than the director, maybe I am too old at 45 year old, maybe I am tired or too far by contemporary cinematographic taste. Yes, the image is completed by inspired performances, the poetry of desert is well reflected , the cliches are at fair place , the relation mother - son has its charme in Oedip - like manner and the portrait of Baron Vladimir Harkonnen is more than wise crafted. And the young Chalamet proves his real skills as admirable actor, Jason Momoa surviving to his character in very nice manner. No doubts, the film represents a generous gift to public from an ambitious director. Is it enough ? Maybe .",negative
"Dune is a really new American movie from 2021 that just got released and I saw that people really liked it, so I got curious and decided to check it out myself. It is a pretty long movie at slightly under 2.5 hours and the director is Denis Villeneuve, perhaps one of the most influential filmmakers right now and maybe number one from Canada. He is also one of the writers and the writing staff also includes an Oscar winner. You can check out the names there yourself. I shall instead elaborate a little more on the cast. Villeneuve being in charge resulted in many big names becoming a part of this project. The lead actor here is Timothée Chalamet, definitely a rising star, but I must say I am not the biggest fan of him really. This is a bit of a problem as he is basically in this movie from beginning to end, but luckily, the supporting cast includes more than a handful actors that I like quite a bit. These would be Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem. With Brolin and Bardem, it felt like a bit of a reunion from No Country for Old Men, especially during the one brief scene/moment in which they clash to some extent. And as we are already talking Coen Bros movies, Isaac's Inside Llewyn Davis deserves a mention as well for sure. So you will find a few actors in here who have worked with the maybe most famous filmmaking brothers duo in the past. Brolin is featured heavily in the first half of the film, but then vanishes completely. Isaac also has more screen time early on. Bardem has a brief scene when his character is introduced, but appears in the last 30 minutes again. I personally thought that he would not show up again with this film, but play a central role in the second movie. Yes, there is a sequel indeed. This already becomes clear when this film here starts as we see a ""part one"" or something and also the way this one ends makes it very obvious that this is not it.As for the rest of the cast, Rebecca Ferguson is almost lead as well, which was okay. Zendaya I am still not buying the hype and she is only really in it near the end. Momoa is on the good side, while Skarsgard and Bautista are on the enemy team. The latter is really making himself a career now if you take a look at everything he has been in, even if it is always supporting parts. His recognition value probably helps as well. Oh yeah, Charlotte Rampling also has a memorable scene in here. I will get to that/her later. Of course, people will immediately think of the David Lynch Dune movie from decades earlier. I will not talk about parallels or differences now with that one because I have not seen it. Let's just focus on this one here instead from a standalone perspective. There is enough to elaborate on anyway. I must still say that I struggle with seeing Chalamet as some kind of hero or chosen character. I don' think he has the props to really pull it off. Of course, this is the idea that he does not look like Hulk or Thor or something, but when I see him show his dedication like how he really wants to join Momoa's character or how he can defeat Brolin's character in a duel or how he leads his mother in the desert and knows exactly how his items and uniform work because he is such a natural or how he in the end says his path leads through the desert, it is difficult to believe. Also how he of course wins the battle against this fella near the end who challenges him. And he has to kill in the process, which also shows us how much of a kindred spirit he is that he has never killed somebody before.Death is a crucial component in here. Still I must say seeing how literally every single good guy, be it Isaac's character, be it Momoa's, be it the seer, goes out in a heroic manner that puts harm to the enemy side was a bit much and eventually also repetitive. There were other issues I struggled with here in terms of the plot. Take a look at the idea of Chalamet's character playing a real hero. Basically he is the future. And yet, his own folk (Rampling's character) were ready to kill him immediately with this poisonous needle if he pulls out his hand from this box that caused so much pain to him. Or his dreams and premonitions linked to Zendaya's character were also not exactly new or inspired the way they were put on display here. I could go on by saying that for example the introduction did feel too long and this movie could have been (or should have been) half an hour shorter perhaps. What I cannot say anything negative about is really the way in which the bad guys attack. When they come for Isaac's character and the others, it is really spectacular and this is when this film is at its very best and an incredibly tense thrill ride. In the middle of the film. Unfortunately, when this is over and the bad guys have won for the moment, it gets a bit weaker again and here and there it drags a bit and has some lengths. What also can be said is that this film is never really intended for comedic purpose. The way you could see it a lot on another Bautista fantasy/sci-fi movie. There was this one moment when Momoa's character talks about Chalamet's character's muscles that was a bit on the playful comedic site and maybe one or two other inclusions as the film went on, but yeah this is not a movie to pick for light relief or something. It takes itself very seriously. Does it have the right to? I am not sure.Of course, there is absolutely nothing wrong with sets, cinematography, costumes and all other visual/audible production fields, but this is pretty much a given now with a film of this dimension, even if we maybe should not see it as a given. With the likes of Zimmer, Roberts and West in charge, however, there is at least as much competence available in ""minor"" departments as there is in front of the camera. If not more. But back to the action itself: With the spectacular visuals, this is definitely a movie you'd rather want to check out at a theater than at home on a small screen. Unless you have a home theater of course. Oh yeah, another moment that will maybe make you smile is how Isaac's character tries to get Brolin's grumpy character to smile really early on. The latter reminds me a bit of the man Brolin played on Sicario. Anyway, I guess we will see more from Brolin's character in the sequel here as well. As for Villeneuve, I must say I liked his earlier stuff like Prisoners, but his recent take on Blade Runner did almost nothing for me unfortunately. Quality-wise, this movie here is somewhere in-between. It's not a revelation or anything and I think the reception is way too positive (I even saw people consider Chalamet for an Oscar nomination, like come on!), but it is worth seeing if you like the genre and some of the cast members I suppose. Not a must-see by any definition though. Seems as if Villeneuve really enjoys giving us his take on some films that are considered classics. It certainly could have turned out worse here, but I hope that with whatever he does in the future, also after this sequel here, he can manage to be a bit more essential again. The pathos felt a bit much at times and did not always ring true. This maybe also could have had to do with Chalamet for me though. If you like him more, you will maybe not see it.The attention to detail at times was still pretty good. I liked Brolin's words during the training sequence linked to Chalamet's character expressing he is not in the mood for fighting or so and how he has to fight when the time is right and how this felt connected to his battle with one character near the end. Completely aside from that, I initially struggled with the sand component, but in the second half they turned the background and location into something special and you could feel the endless desert element finally. Also the idea of these sandworms was depicted nicely. Or how a ring is used to print a seal or signature. Or these helicopters that look like insects. Or the little drone, so it is not just the big spectacular inclusions where you can see all the talent that was included in the making of this film. Unfortunately, there were also many struggles. I mentioned most of them, but while I already stated that the introduction felt too long, the real introduction at the very start felt incredibly rushed and it was impossible to remember all they mentioned there. Pretty much a no-go for a film with this running time. All in all, I still give it a thumbs-up and I think the good is more frequent than the weak, but there's no way I would say that this is among the very best films of the year 2021 so far. Maybe the better, but not the best and I hope that Villeneuve can step things up with the second film, but given the lead actor I kinda doubt it. Anyway, if you like this one, you can probably keep watching. Maybe said sequel is out already once you read this review of mine and then you can decide for yourself anyway.",negative
"The Duke (Oscar Isaac) is sent by the empire to take control of the spice operations on Arrakis, which sounds like Iraqis. It is inhospitable and the locals have seen empires come and go who try to rule over them. (Reminded me of Afghanistan.) The Duke wants to have peace. The Duke's son Paul (Timothée Chalamet) is the main character and has too much of his mother (Rebecca Ferguson) in him. She comes from a long line of witches and he has some of their powers such as ""The Voice"" and ""The Sight"" which is similar to ""The Force."" He dreams of a girl (who doesn't?) and of things to come. As it turns out, the empire was quite honest with them.I have never read the book. Three of us watched the first one on VHS and fell asleep during the film. The machines looked like they came out of ""Star Wars.""

"It's been some time since I've read the Frank Herbert novel, and I had already forgotten much of the story. However it wasn't a problem picking things up as characters and situations presented themselves in this film, so I'd have to say that was a plus for this viewer. The scope of this picture is quite outstanding, spanning as it does a complex and fragmented universe of worlds and kingdoms. Central to the story is the valued importance placed on a spice that's a preferred hallucinogenic for some, and for the elite, an important component required for interstellar travel. In the novel I believe it was something as common as cinnamon, but on the planet Arrakis, required an intensive mining operation to reclaim it from the barren desert soil in which it's found.The entire story is veiled with a mystical sort of ambiance in which the protagonist, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), learns of his destiny while obliquely being referred to as 'The One' of legend, a person who will come into great power. Quite honestly, the setting, costuming, characterizations and palace intrigue is all quite reminiscent of 'Star Wars', even if the original novel was written over a decade before George Lucas arrived on the scene. Even the hostile environment of Arrakis has the feel of Tatooine, with the appearance of the Shai-Hulud recalling the Sarlacc, one of Jabba the Hutt's favorite pets.What surprised me with this first installment of the Dune saga was how well director Denis Villeneuve managed to condense the epic scope of a massive novel onto film, even if half of the story is yet to be told. The movie incorporates the most critical elements of the novel into a narrative that works really well. Even though I actually did enjoy the 1984 version directed by David Lynch, this one proves to be more inclusive of events in the novel, and I look forward to a successful conclusion to the saga in due time.",positive
"I've never read Frank Herbert's novel or seen any other adaptation of ""Dune"", so I have to take Denis Villeneuve's adaptation as the guide. It's an impressive movie. Not just the visuals, but in the story's complexity. Timothée Chalamet continues to reaffirm himself as one of the greatest actors of his generation.I'm eager to see part 2, as well as David Lynch's adaptation.",positive
"The 1984 David Lynch movie was a box office flop and has been garnered with mixed to negative reviews over the years, but the trailer for the new movie, based on the cult book by Frank Herbert, looked like it would be much better, directed by Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Arrival, Blade Runner 2049). Basically, in the distant future, the year, 10,191, in the known universe, Duke Leto of House Atreides (Oscar Isaac), ruler of the ocean planet Caladan, is assigned by the Padishah Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV to replace House Harkonnen as fief rulers of Arrakis. The planet Arrakis is a barren desert planet populated by gigantic sandworms, better known as Dune. It is the universe's only source of the spice called melange, a drug that extends life and expands consciousness. The Spice is also critical for safe instantaneous interstellar travel to any distance in space. Shaddam intends to have House Harkonnen stage a coup to retake the planet with aid of the Emperor's Sardaukar troops, eradicating House Atreides, who threaten Shaddam's control. Leto is apprehensive but sees the political advantages of controlling the spice planet, and an alliance with its native population, skilled fighters known as the Fremen. Leto's concubine Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) is part of the Bene Gesserit, an exclusively female order with advanced physical and mental abilities. Although Jessica was instructed by the Bene Gesserit to bear a daughter to descend and become the Kwisatz Haderach (""one who can be many places at once""), she instead gave birth to a son, Paul (Timothée Chalamet). Throughout his life, Paul has been trained by Leto's aides, Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa), Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin) and the Mentat Thufir Hawat (Stephen McKinley Henderson), while Jessica trains Paul in disciplines of the Bene Gesserit. Paul talks to Jessica and Duncan about troubling visions he has had of the future. Due to these visions, the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling) visits Caladan and subjects Paul to a deadly test. He is subjected to experience excruciating pain to his hand, to assess his impulse control, which he passes. Later, Mohiam instructs House patriarch Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) to not kill Paul and Jessica during his coup. He agrees not to harm them but intends to cause their deaths indirectly to end their bloodline. House Atreides arrives at Arrakeen, capital city and fortress stronghold on Arrakis, where Duncan and an advance party have been learning about the world and the Fremen. Leto negotiates with the Fremen's chieftain Stilgar (Javier Bardem) and meets planetologist and imperial judge Dr. Liet-Kynes (Sharon Duncan-Brewster). Kynes explains the dangers of spice harvesting to Leto, Paul, and Halleck, including the giant sandworms. During a flight, they spot a sandworm approaching an active spice harvester with a stranded crew. Leto and his team rescue the workers moments before the sandworm swallows it. Paul's exposure to spice-laden air triggers intense premonitions. Following an attempt by a Harkonnen agent to kill Paul, Leto's soldiers are put on high alert. Suk doctor Wellington Yueh (Chang Chen) disables Arrakeen's critical protective shields, allowing Harkonnen and Sardaukar troops to overwhelm the Atreides forces. Yueh incapacitates Leto and tells him he made a deal with the Baron to deliver him in exchange for freeing his captive wife. Yueh poisons Leto with a gas capsule and is killed after delivering the Duke. Leto releases the poison gas, killing himself and members of the Baron's court, but the Baron survives. Duncan escapes and steals an ornithopter (an aircraft with rapidly flapping wings). Harkonnens capture Paul and Jessica and intend to drop them in the desert to perish. Paul and Jessica overpower and kill their captors using a Bene Gesserit power called ""The Voice"" to control others verbally. Finding a survival kit left for them by Yueh, Paul and Jessica spend the night in a tent. Paul experiences visions of a ""holy war"" spreading across the universe and him leading it. The Baron hands over command of Arrakis to his brutish nephew Rabban aka ""Beast"" (Dave Bautista) and orders him to sell spice reserves and restart production to recover the cost of the coup. Paul and Jessica are found by Duncan and Kynes and head to an old research station but are soon tracked down by Sardaukar. Jessica, Paul and Kynes are allowed to escape the facility when Duncan and various Fremen sacrifice themselves. Kynes, ambushed by Sardaukar troops, lures a sandworm that devours them along with her. Paul and Jessica reach the deep desert and meet the Fremen, among them are Stilgar and young warrior Chani (Zendaya), who Paul has seen in his visions. Their admission into the tribe is protested by Fremen warrior Jamis (Babs Olusanmokun), so they have a ritual duel to the death, and Paul is victorious. Against Jessica's wishes, Paul states they will remain on Arrakis with the Fremen to reclaim the planet. Also starring David Dastmalchian as Piter de Vries, Benjamin Clémentine as Herald of the Change, Golda Rosheuvel as Shadout Mapes, and Roger Yuan as Lieutenant Lanville. I'm not going to pretend I understood everything going on, with all the stuff involving religion and politics, just the main plot that everyone wants the spice. Chalamet makes for a good young hero, Skarsgård is good at being the nasty and grotesque villain, and the all-star cast, including Isaac, Brolin, Rampling, Zendaya, and Bardem all get their moments as well. The visuals and special effects are fantastic, from the spaceships and alien creatures to the interior and exterior locations and large-scale battle scenes, so it doesn't matter if you don't understand it all, it is a great spectacle, and hopefully the second part will be as exciting, a worthwhile epic science-fiction adventure. Very good!",positive
"Sure, I was looking forward to getting to watch director Denis Villeneuve's take on Frank Herbert's iconic story ""Dune"". And yeah, I did also enjoy the 1984 version of the tale, so of course this 2021 version was something that had to be watched.And yes, I did enjoy the 2021 rendering of ""Dune"", of course I did. I mean, how could I not? Despite of running for a bit more than two and a half hours, the movie was entertaining and enjoyable. And this was just the first part of the story, so we are in for more.Visually then ""Dune"" was just spectacular, having pretty amazing special effects that brought the world of Arrakis to life on the screen. And if you enjoy CGI effects and great special effects, then ""Dune"" doesn't disappoint.In terms of casted performers, then the majority of the cast were actually nicely cast for the various roles and characters. Now, I am not familiar with Timothée Chalamet (playing Paul Atreides), but he was no Kyle MacLachlan (playing the same character in the 1984 movie). This 2021 version of ""Dune"" also have the likes of Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Jason Momoa, Josh Brolin and Stellan Skarsgård on the cast list. I was really impressed with Stellan Skarsgård in the movie.And while ""Dune"" is watchable and entertaining, I must admit that I was left with a sense of 'was this really a necessary remake?' once the movie ended. And then my thoughts went on to ""will it be remade again in 40 years, with whatever technology is available then?'. So there was that whole whether this remake was a necessary thing or not looming over it.And I also feel that the character gallery was a bit underdeveloped, as I felt most of the characters were only given superficial characteristics and personalities, never letting the audience really get to know the characters backgrounds, motivations and such. It just felt a bit too shallow in terms of character development and growth.If you have the chance to watch ""Dune"", then do so. By all means do so, because it is an entertaining movie.My rating of ""Dune"" lands on a six out of ten stars, like the 1984 movie. Sure, this 2021 movie was more pleasing to look at, but of course almost 40 years have done lots to the development of CGI in the movie business. But the 2021 version is held back by an inferior character gallery and that overwhelming sense of this being essentially just a massive waste of money and effort in terms of remaking something that didn't really need to be remade.",positive
"The visuals are pretty impressive. Even though the colour palette is monotonous, the visuals are beautiful and captivating. The story is ending, albeit slow at times. I really like Timothee Chamalet's character. Overall, I liked it.",positive
"Fans of ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962) might recognise the bleak scenery around Wadi Rum, one of many stunningly beautiful and evocative locations used is this epic piece of cinema. It is that photography, and another hugely complimentary score from Hans Zimmer, that perfectly sets the template for this adaptation of Frank Herbert's story of family, avarice and power. I was sceptical about it being split into two parts (especially given the lengthy delay between this and the sequel) but it really works well. The unseen Emperor of the Known Universe commands that house ""Atreides"" take over the mining of the valuable ""spice"" from their arch enemy the ""Harkonnen"", and so the Duke (Oscar Isaac), his wife ""Jessica"" (Rebecca Ferguson) and son ""Paul"" (Timothée Chalamet) must prepare to relocate to their new and distinctly hostile desert world. It is clear from the outset that young man is troubled. He sleeps fitfully with strange dreams all set upon a planet he has studied but never visited. Upon arrival, they are betrayed and the young man and his mother must find and befriend the local ""Fremen"" population and learn how to survive and to fight back. Now I won't fib, it does drag a bit at times, and if you already know the story from either the book, or the David Lynch version from 1984, then that can lead to you wanting to shout ""get on with it"" at the big screen, but being patient with this brings it's own rewards. The attention to the detail, and the grand scale of this feature is immersive, it draws you in and there is enough action, and food-for-thought to sustain that interest for the most part. Chalamet offers us a strong and engaging performance. He is growing as an actor, maturing - and though he still looks like a decent meal would kill him, he owns the picture in a way (for me, anyway) that he never has before. The remaining cast members gel well together, and the mysticism and political manoeuvring that underpins this story is subtle and nuanced but potent in it's presentation. The costumes and visual effects are splendid - I want one of the locust-copters (though heaven only knows what the vibrations must be like onboard!), and we do get a sense - but really only that - of the enormity of the giant worms that patrol the desert looking for their quarry. The second part of the novel was always the more interesting. We will see the characters develop more, and we will learn more of the troubled ""Paul"" and of whom he really is - as well as there being much more actually going on. If this is the standard of the opening gambit, then what is to come ought to be wonderful.",positive
"Spice, a substance mined only from the deserts of planet Arrakis, is the most valuable commodity in the galaxies since it enables interstellar transport. The violent and sadistic Harkonnen family have help the spice mining franchise for 40 years, becoming immensely wealthy in the process, alienating Arrakis natives the Fremen in the process. The Emperor abruptly appoints the Atreides family instead, infuriating the Harkonnens who sabotage equipment left behind, and plan a violent takeback. This results in heir apparent Paul Atreides and mother Jessica being abandoned in the desert, where they need to fall in with desert experts the Fremen in order to survive. Trouble is, after 40 years of the Harkonnens, the Fremen aren't very keen on offworlders.And.... end of part one. We are halfway through the story, with a part two which may never be greenlit if box office doesn't justify it which, in this post-covid world sounds somewhat unlikely. So what's part one like?My history of Dune and director Denis Villeneuve meant I was not hopeful. I read the novel in my teens in the 1960s and found it dense and impenetrable. David Lynch's movie had its moments, but got hacked about by the studio. The later TV series was more lucid, but suffered from some really poor casting and acting. And I had problems with Glade Runner 2049 and Arrival, both of which were a bit too cerebral for me, and less clear than I would have liked from a narrative stanndpoint.Dune (part one) 2021 is a fine film. It looks amazing, which one would expect these days. The casting - and acting - is excellent. And the script/adaptation is first rate. The power games which underlie the main plot are clear and obvious, the interplay of character dynamics is solid, subtle story points come through, all the little bits you need to understand are explained organically without huge obvious information dumps, and the story flows easily throughout the two and a half hours.I have two reservations. One, the film isn't as significant as it sometimes seems to think it is. And, two, Hans Zimmer's score is dissonant, intrusive and aggressive and I actively disliked it.But I liked the film very much, and I greatly hope there will be a part two.",positive
"Greetings again from the darkness. It's been nearly 40 years since David Lynch directed DUNE (1984). The film received an Oscar nomination for Best Sound, and has since been a cult favorite, though not one I'm particularly drawn to. All these years later, Frank Herbert's 1965 novel (there are 5 sequel novels) has been re-made by acclaimed writer-director Denis Villeneuve (ARRIVAL, 2016) and his co-writers Eric Roth (Oscar winner, FORREST GUMP, 1994) and Joe Spaihts (PROMETHEUS, 2012). The new version looks absolutely fantastic, even if the story is a bit convoluted and the characters don't always make the best, or even logical, decisions.The year is 10191, likely the most futuristic movie we've seen. Oscar Isaac is Duke Letto Atreides and Rebecca Ferguson is Lady Jessica Atreides, though the story mostly focuses on the son, Paul, played by Timothy Chalamet. The story revolves around the protection of spice, the most valuable resource in the universe/galaxy. However the real focus is on politics and power plays ... so I guess not much really changes over the next 8170 years - except, of course, the colonization and travel between multiple planets (surprisingly, none of these planets is named Elon or Bezos). There is much talk of ""the plan"" with emphasis on whether young Paul is ""the one"" mentioned in their legends. Paul does have some special abilities, but Chalamet's understated (and mostly monotone) portrayal makes everyone, even Lady Jessica, a bit unsure of whether he's the leader they need.The supporting cast is impressive and all do their part to drive the action and story forward. Jason Mamoa is Duncan Idaho, the warrior who humorously belittles Paul's fragile physical frame. Josh Brolin is Gurney Halleck, the bodyguard to the noble family, and Charlotte Rampling plays the Reverend Mother (a creepy nun). Oscar winner Javier Bardem is under-utilized as Stilgar, while Zendaya shines as Chani, one who bonds with Paul. Of course the most outrageous role finds Stellan Skarsgard (with some heavy make-up and special effects) as the grand emperor of Harkonnen, with Dave Bautista as his brother, the Beast.For me, the movie's technical aspects are what stand out. It deserves awards consideration in multiple categories, especially Sound, Visual Effects, Cinematography, and Score. Oscar winner Hans Zimmer really delivers a score that compliments and enhances what we see on screen. Cinematographer Greig Fraser has been involved in numerous high profile projects, like ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY (2016) and the highly anticipated THE BATMAN (coming in 2022). The effects are special and include the sandworms, as well as dragonfly choppers that are quite impressive. It was a bit annoying to see the desert sand blowing constantly, yet goggles and masks are hardly ever used. I guess these faces are too expensive to cover up!Familiarity abounds as some bits recall MAD MAX, EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, STAR WARS, and THE MATRIX. Director Villeneuve shot the film in Norway and Jordan, and to answer the question from fans of the original ... no, Sting does not make a cameo appearance. The film looks stunning and will likely satisfy the target audience. Whether it's enough to expand the audience is something we will know soon enough. The film ends with ""This is only the beginning"", and Mr. Villeneuve has Dune Part Two in the planning stages.The film will be released October 22, 2021 in theaters, on IMAX, and streaming on HBO Max.",positive
"I am one of those few people who thought Lynch's 1984 Dune was great. It was terribly edited and had other flaws, but it captured what I feel is the essence of the book. Of course it wasn't exactly like the book, it couldn't have been. Enter Denis's Dune, 2021, everything can be done on a computer, actors have had decades to refine the craft, films are not forced to be one hour and a half anymore, the budgets are astronomical. So how is it? I liked it, but I feel that it was something closer to what someone does after thinking for a long about how they would fix 1984 Dune rather than a reinterpretation of the book or even a very dry rerendering of it like the 2000 miniseries.There are two things I really didn't like. One of them is the flat refusal to do anything that might be considered R-rated. The film is butchered to blandness, even when it features vicious knife fights, large scale warfare and sadistic Harkonnen. Second is Jessica's character, who is portrayed as a weakling, rather than the incredibly resourceful Bene Gesserit who has been trained for years that she is. I love Rebecca Ferguson, but she is not right in this film and nor is her character.The visuals, while impressive, were kind of subdued, too. The mutated Navigators don't even make an appearance, the Harkonnen look big and fearsome, but clean and not really vile, the worms are shown with restraint, the colors are muted, the clothes and overall attire are simple, functional and uninteresting.Bottom line: I am sorry to say that I think Lynch's film would have probably been better if the same resources and artistic freedom would have been awarded to him. This Dune doesn't really show as much an improvement as 37 years of thinking about it should have warranted. And it is tame and lame, refusing to take the artistic risks that should have been taken to portray with today's technology and knowledge a world 8000 years into the future and described with so much care and attention in Herbert's books.Well, back to reading all the books again and dreaming for the next 40 years of an adaptation of God Emperor of Dune...",negative
"I wasn't a big fan of Dune when I read it. It was like a sci-fi/fantasy take on an old sword-and-sandal political intrigue thing, complete with dull characters and dumb story.On the other hand, it had this wonderfully anthropological creation of a desert world and its people. That was the only reason I got through it.Dune Part One is the first part without the second part. The characters are still dull, the plot still dumb, and the sci-fi world-building almost non-existent. The scenery and special effects are quite good, but nothing is interesting; even action scenes are listless.Will Dune Part Two offer the world-building that was the only good part of the book? Doubt it. Anyway, I certainly can't take any more of this.",negative
"I want to start by saying the most important thing. If you want to see this movie, WATCH IT IN IMAX. Or at the very least any premium screen (ultrascreen, emax, etc). Definitely don't watch it on HBO max unless you have a full theater system with surround sound. Whoever made the decision to simultaneously release this on VOD is a moron. It benefits from a theater viewing more than any movie since Tenet, maybe longer.The other most important thing to know is, this is half of a movie. It's basically incomplete. The first part of a 5 hour epic. I wish i knew that going in. I started becoming anxious because the story didn't seem to be progressing at all. I finally realized that the ""part one"" in the opening title was for the entire movie. It feels more like a setup movie than it's own story.The things i liked... there is so much. From a technical perspective, this is an absolute masterpiece. The directing, cinematography and music are all maximum top-notch quality. This isn't surprising, we've seen this from director denis villeneuve (omg arrival). And of course hans is the GOAT movie composer. They are why this movie is epic, to the fullest extent of the word. They are why half the scenes feel like the biggest moment of a normal movie.More on the music, i've been asking for something like this for a while. Where the music is the driving force of the scene, but not just for one or two scenes, but the whole movie. Forget about dialogue during these parts, just marvel at the visual and auditory explosion of beauty.So my dilemma is, how do i score this. I really hope they make a second one, and if it's awesome, i can see myself always rewatching them back to back as a single long movie. But if they don't make one, or if it sucks, i can't see myself coming back to this more than once.I will give it 7 stars (awesome) for now. Depending on the outcomes mentioned above, i could see myself dropping it to a 6 (good) or upping it to an 8 (amazing). (1 viewing, opening night 10/21/2021)",positive
"Greetings from Lithuania.""Dune. Part I"" (2021) was amazing cinematic experience. This is a movie that demands to be seen on a big screen, no less. I haven't read a book nor seen previous version of it, therefore all things that i saw story wise were fresh for me. And i won't lie i did felt to be lost here and there, but at the end of the day the storyline was clear.The visual side of this movie was staggering. This is a 100% movie going experience. Special effects looked as real as it gets - if you enjoyed visual side of ""Blade Runner 2049"" you will get same here - grandiose sets, design, sound and all technical stuff - this movie at every scene looked breathtaking. Yet i wished cinematography was done by Roger Deakins, but still it was solid (but could been even better). Acting was very good by all involved - you can't ask for more from such a cast.Overall, few reasons why i did not gave it 10/10 is because it did felt like a set up of a story more then once - way more then once. Also there are some pacing issues here and there. And finally, this movie will loose ~80% of its visual side when watched at home in my opinion, this is a real movie going experience. But at the end i liked it very much and would like to see Part II - fingers crossed!",positive
"Director Denis Villeneuve's attempt to improve on Director David Lynch's 1984 version of Dune fails in a number of respects. First. The pacing of this movie is slow and plodding. Second. The absence of the any Emperor scenes that Lynch so lavishly displayed on the scene offered up a spectacular science fiction motif missing in Villeneuve's version. Third. The absence of the powerful use of spice, a crucial element of the movie in space travel. Fourth. The casting and directing is rather mundane without the sharp and powerful characterization that Lynch cast. The Baron's character is a dull, a toned down shadow of Lynch's version while Duke Leto is a weakened version of Lynch's more dignified and royal persona. Lady Jessica seems too young and dismissive and also less than royal while his son Paul also does not seem to have the royal statue either. Fifth. The color, backdrop were wrong. Most of the scenes were shot in unnecessarily darkened shadows, Caladan, the water planet, had too much earth in comparison to the striking Arrakis, the desert planet, and anybody who has experienced the desert would realize how bright and powerfully sunny such scenes should be. It was hard to see what was going on in detail with many scenes. Lynch was able to incorporate this light and darkness, water and sand to a brilliant contrast. Sixth. Little important details went missing, especially the poor use of voice over that Lynch captured the thoughts of Frank Herbert's novel that helped to enhance many of the scenes such as the observation that people were more important than spice or how Paul was able to fit a skinsuit so well. Seventh. Unnecessary fillers that included a scene of Jessica and Paul in a after a crash that was not included in Lynch's version while Lynch included an extended fight training scenes and the use of the voice that enhanced the development of the plot even even though the special effect was crude using the box. Dream sequences were not photographed well as dreams like Lynch nor the blue eyes as effectively presented. Villenueve also used too many dream shots unlike the more selective and carefully edited nuanced use of dream scenes. Eighth. Villenueve offered up too many reveals too soon instead of the more tantalizing surprise discoveries of the audience to experience. It is really hard to describe in detail all the problems with this movie with one screening, but it seems that what Villenueve created was a mainstream popularized version of a science fiction classic with plenty of special effects but without the compelling edginess nor the strong characters that Dune requires.",negative
"Although the film is called 'Dune', the opening title refers to it as 'Dune Part One'. I knew, when I saw this, it probably should have been better to wait for Part Two before watching it. As a result some characters felt underdeveloped, and some simply vanished halfway through the movie. They also kept talking about Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) being 'The One', but the one for what? This somehow reminded me of Neo from 'The Matrix', also being 'The One'.Regardless, 'Dune' is a spectacle of note. From the stunning visuals, state of the art CGI, production design, and cinematography, to good performances from a stellar cast and a great score, this is one amazing movie. Sure, the film won't satisfy everyone's palate, and if you're not a sci-fi/fantasy fan, 'Dune' will not appeal to you. However, one can't help but be impressed by what they've accomplished.Ok, now, you can crucify me if you want, but for me there were some issues with the film. With the movie being so long, I later found myself thinking there's a hell of a lot going on, with very little happening. Maybe this is because this is not a completed movie (being Part One), but I didn't always understand the character motives, and I still don't really understand what Paul's real mission is. Spice is the most valuable substance in the universe, and I understand Paul follows in his Father's footsteps to preserve the spice production, but he is always on the move and I don't follow whereto. It sometimes also felt like they were holding back on the action sequences. Some of the action scenes ended so abruptly...Also, large parts of the movie reminded me of other films, like 'Tremors', 'The Chronicles of Riddick', and 'Star Wars'. Then a number of credibility issues. The film is set in 10191, but there were medieval elements here as well. Will they still be using scrolls so far into the future to read messages from? Will they still read books? Will they address leaders as ""My Lord""? This, and their costumes, felt very dated.If the film was about 30 minutes shorter, it would have been much better paced, with all the unnecessary scenes on the cutting room floor. It was just too long to keep me entertained for the entire 155 minutes, no matter how astonishing the production values.Ok, now that I've had my rant, 'Dune' is still an incredibly well made film, and worth watching at least once.",positive
"Dune: Part One is an Action - Drama movie in which we watch a son of a very important family many thousands of years in the future trying to secure and protect the most valuable asset in the galaxy.I had watched a documentary about this movie so, I knew the story behind it. ""Dune"" is more like a drama, science fiction movie than action due to the very few action scenes. I enjoyed it because I knew the story, the music was simply amazing and the direction which was made by Denis Villeneuve was simply outstanding. The interpretation of Timothée Chalamet who played as Paul Atreides was breathtaking and he made the difference. Other interpretations that need to be mentioned were Oscar Isaac's who played as Duke Leto Atreides, Rebecca Ferguson's who played as Lady Jessica Atreides, Jason Momoa's who played as Duncan Idaho and Stellan Skarsgård's who played as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen. Lastly, I have to say that ""Dune: Part One"" is an amazing movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it.",positive
"4 out of 5 starsDune is a beautifully done epic science fiction film that is the start of a new sci fi franchise. Or an attempt to revive one. Even with the opening title saying Dune Part one. I never read the novels. Only knowing the film is the first half of the first Dune novel. Leaving the film with half a story and no climax. Which is frustrating and exciting to see more films. One can hope this film is a success for more. Which it does deserve more films.The plot is good and does open up for an epic story. Paul (Timothee Chalamet) is from the House of Atreides. Which he accompanies his parents to Arrakis which is a homeworld that has spice produced in the desert. Spice can be used for intergalactic travel. House of Atreides is looking for a reasonable peaceful trade. While House of Harkonnen lead by Baron (Stellan Skarsgard) is sending his army to Arrakis for an all out war.The cast ensemble is huge and every one did great playing there characters. Timothee Chalamet taking the main role was phenomenal. Rebecca Ferguson was also good. Along with Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, and Jason Momoa was good. Zendaya is fantastic even if her role was short. But saved for a sequel.Script did a great job with the world building and details on setting up the story. Great with the character building. Even for being a complex book. Director Denis Villeneuve did a great job in making this film a cinematic masterpiece. You can expect great cinematography set up in capturing beautiful landscapes. Visual effects. And having Hans Zimmers music score blasted at a high volume. Every sequence is designed for a cinematic scope to be seen on the big screen at the theatre with a great sound quality. Also, a down side on what you can expect from Denis Villeneuve is the slow pacing.The film does have some action sequences with great visual effects. The giant sandworm sequence is cool. Do not expect any big battle sequences. There is a brief battle scene in a dream sequence that is hinting towards the next film.Positives: the film is a good start for a franchise. The scope with action, visual effects, cast ensemble, production sets, music score, and direction all aims high for a cinematic experience that is epic and loud. It is one spectacular experience. The action sequences were good. Also ending abruptly for more films, do not expect a big climatic battle.Negatives: director Denis Villeneuve is fantastic in making a cinematic visual feast. He does take his time with his storytelling even with a slow pacing. Which he suffers in all his films.Overall, Dune is a good science fiction film which is spectacular and epic. I am excited and hoping to see more films. It delivered with a great world building for the story, visual effects, and action. It deserves to be seen on the big screen theatres.",positive
"Despite being a fan of sci-fi and fantasy fare, I had never read Frank Herbert's ""Dune"" novel. To be honest, the plot summaries of trade wars and odd names didn't exactly appeal to me. So, I came into this film armed only with the expectations that director Dennis Villeneuve (one of my favorite film helmsmen) would probably do a good job with the material. That sentiment turned out to be an enormous understatement.For a very basic overview, ""Dune"" tells the story--set thousands of years into the future--of the planet Arrakis, notable in the galaxy for its rich deposits of a spice that powers interstellar travel. Once ruled by House Harkonnen, Arrakis is being transferred to a new bloodline, that of House Atreides--with much political intrigue afoot. Central to all this is Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet), a young man who not only is being recruited into a behind-the-scenes string-pulling society inhabited by his mother (Rebecca Ferguson), but also begins having visions of fulfilling a savior prophecy amongst the Fremen (Arrakis' desert inhabitants). Truth be told, trying to sum up ""Dune"" in a few sentences is nearly impossible and comes off sounding boring or trite. Rest assured, however, that the film is anything but.Perhaps the biggest draw here is the work of director Villeneuve, who may now be nipping at the heels of Christopher Nolan in terms of directors with the prominence to create a project with this type of scale. His ability to take a plot that, yes, essentially stems from a trade war and make it utterly compelling cinema is remarkable. It's Star Wars meets Lord of the Rings with the best themes of each franchise being showcased.Having a stellar cast certainly doesn't hurt, either. Besides Chalamet & Ferguson (both excellent), veterans of the craft like Oscar Isaac, Jason Momoa, Stellen Skarsgard, Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, & Zendaya play key roles. In a film that requires characters to look and feel epic in nature, that is easily accomplished with such a distinguished group.The visuals and music soundtrack also heavily contribute to the sense of scale in ""Dune"". While not flashy in any way, this is a film that begs to be seen on the big screen, where the planetary geography, interesting technology, and swelling score from Hans Zimmer can all best penetrate the senses.Yes, this film is technically ""half a movie"" in that a sequel will be released at a later date to cover the rest of the source novel. But never for a moment did I feel in any way cheated or frustrated by this fact. In this case, I actually appreciated the way the filmmakers set the groundwork without rushing to try and cram everything into a single runtime.Overall, my theater experience while watching ""Dune"" was one of the best I've had in some time. Truth be told, the only reason I deduct even one star is because I have to wait to pass final judgement until the sequel is finished. But I'll have absolutely no trouble going back to re-watch this effort again in anticipation of that conclusion. In a film era of endless sequels and IP-related projects, ""Dune"" felt original and fresh in a way that is (sadly) growing more and more rare.",positive
"Wes Anderson's latest movie, under thinly disguised names, supposes that Harold Ross, instead of going to New York to found THE NEW YORKER, had moved to France. There, with the same writers and cartoonists, he turned out essentially the same magazine, but with, understandably, more of an emphasis on France than on Broadway. We are then graced with Bill Murray as the editor dealing with his writers, as Tilda Swinton narrates her tale of insane prisoner Benicio Del Toro inventing a new movement in art; Frances MacDormand covering a student uprising while bedding leader Timothée Chalamet, while editing and writing an appendix to his revolutionary manifesto; and Jeffrey Wright covering the novelties of ""cuisine policier"" with the commissioner, which turns into a hot pursuit as the commissioner's child is kidnapped, and his chef must take the lead in the recovery.I am a great fan of Anderson's cartoonish, highly detailed cinematic worlds, in no small part because he is constantly winking at the audience, letting them know they are in on the joke, as he manipulates aspect ratios, colors, timelines, and moves walls aside in plain sight, His actors seem to enjoy themselves. This is Bill Murray's ninth appearance in an Anderson movie, Owen Wilson's eighth. Other well-regarded performers include Lea Sedoux, Mathieu Amalric, Bob Balaban, Henry Winkler, Christopher Waltz, Willem Dafoe, and a dozen others. Nor do they come for the big parts; they seem to be happy to show up. When the show ended, two men in the audience began to discuss how the aspect ratios and moving walls had some significance to the underlying meaning. Perhaps I lack the depth to understand such things, but I think Anderson tells his little tales and wants us to have a good time. Does that make it great art? Perhaps not.

"Greetings again from the darkness. Few things in the cinematic world are more instantly recognizable than a Wes Anderson movie. In fact, historically speaking, perhaps only Jacques Tati comes as close to having a signature style easily spotted by viewers. This is Mr. Anderson's 10th feature film in 25 years, and I now rate 5 of these very highly, though all 10 have a certain appeal. This latest, co-written by Anderson with frequent collaborators Roman Coppola, Hugo Guinness, and Jason Schwartzman, could be considered his most ambitious to date ... and likely the most 'Wes Anderson' of all.Billed as a love letter to journalists, it becomes crystal clear, that by this, Anderson means the esteemed stable of writers from the early days of ""The New Yorker"". In fact, Anderson structures the film as if it were following the path of a magazine being published. We are informed upfront that this edition features ""an obituary, a travel guide, and 3 feature articles"". An episodic format is not unusual for films, yet Anderson never does anything by the book. Each piece takes place in its own time period, and there appears to be little connection or crossover among key characters. Still, somehow he makes this work by ensuring each piece stands on its own and is filled with unusual characters and those patented, fabulous Anderson visuals.The obituary is that of Arthur Howitzer Jr (a deadpan Bill Murray), the founder and publisher of ""The French Dispatch"" magazine, a spin-off from The Liberty Kansas Evening Sun ... a move from a small town in Midwestern United States to a charming small town in France (hilariously and fittingly) named Ennui-sur-Blasé. Howitzer adores his writers, and the only guidance he offers them is, ""Just try to make it sound like you wrote it that way on purpose"". He also has a ""No Crying"" sign posted in his office, likely as much as a reminder to himself as a rule for the staff.Our travel guide section is fortunately quite brief since it involves Owen Wilson as a bicycle tour guide showing us around the town - the ""Local Color""- of Ennui-sur-Blasé. This takes us to the first feature story, and the best of the lot. Tilda Swinton excels (doesn't she always?) as a writer and art expert giving a colorful lecture entitled ""The Concrete Masterpiece"". She tells the story of Moses Rosenthaler (Benecio del Toro), a genius modern artist serving a life sentence for murder, and as she lectures, we see it play out. While incarcerated, Moses continues to work and his muse is a prison guard named Simone, played exceptionally well by Lea Seydoux. Her nude posing for him leads to his signature modern art piece, which attracts the attention of an ambitious art dealer played by Adrien Brody.""Revisions to a Manifesto"" is the next feature, and it involves a young activist named Zeffirelli (Timothee Chalamet). He's a chess expert, quite moody and has a questionable quest. He's being covered by writer Lucinda Krementz (Frances McDormand), who is unable to maintain objectivity, and inserts herself right into the story, amongst other things. The segment pays tribute to the activism of the 1960's and is filmed mostly in black and white.The third feature, ""The Private Dining Room of the Police Commissioner"" involves writer Roebuck Wright (Jeffrey Wright) telling his story while a guest on Liev Schreiber's Talk Show in the 1970's. Roebuck is obviously inspired by James Baldwin, and he famously recalls every line he's ever written. The story he recites involves a legendary chef played by Steve Park.Actors mentioned so far are just the headliners, and Anderson has packed the film with his usual troupe, as well as dozens of others - some you'll recognize, and some you won't. There are at least seven Oscar winners involved: Christoph Waltz, Fisher Stevens, and Angelica Huston (as narrator), in addition to the aforementioned Swinton, McDormand, del Toro, and Brody. Numerous Oscar nominations and awards are included in the group of other familiar faces like Willem Dafoe, Saoirse Ronan, Edward Norton, Lois Smith, Henry Winkler Bob Balaban, Elisabeth Moss, and Mathieu Amalric.Other frequent Anderson collaborators who deliver standout work include Production Designer Adam Stockhausen, Cinematographer Robert Yeoman, Editor Andrew Weisblum, and composer Alexandre Desplat. The film looks and sounds remarkable, and somehow it doesn't feel like it's moving fast - although we can barely keep pace. The film can be compared to ordering a flight at your local distillery. Each flavor is tasty, but they may not add up to a full drink.Wes Anderson has delivered another stylish, fun film to watch, and one that is endlessly entertaining. It may not have as many moments of laughter as some of his previous films, yet there are still plenty of sight gags, insider references, and light-heartedness bathed in nostalgia - even if it's not quite as whimsical. Shot in the French town of Angouleme, the visuals are as impressive as any you'll find, serving up a collage of time, caricatures, color, and topics.Opening nationwide in theaters on October 29, 2021.",positive
"I assure you it's erotic, J. K. L. Berensen (Tilda Swinton) from ""The Concrete Masterpiece"" segment.If Wes Anderson's stylish fantasy The French Dispatch is not ""erotic,"" it's at least his most imaginative and discursive yet Anderson-derivative film -making Grand Budapest feel like a cohesive tribute (to Austrian Writer Stefan Zweig). He throws his stable of actors into a Francophiliac stew of five discursive stories seemingly ripped from the titular newsmagazine reminiscent of The New Yorker.Although not uproariously funny, it is so quirky and eccentric that you won't even mind the first time around missing characters patterned after such editors as H. L. Mencken and William Shawn. Whoever Bill Murray's editor Howitzer is supposed to be, he is ultimately the essential grumpy top newsman, no-holds-barred dictator, who shuts up an underling he's firing with his motto, ""No Crying.""Anderson and his story collaborators Roman Coppola and Jason Schwartzman (relatives of Francis Ford) and Hugo Guinness frame five fantastic stories in the eccentric town of Ennui-Sur-Blasé. They begin with episode one's Local Color section telling of a rough, imprisoned artist Moses Rosenthaler (Benicio del Toro), whose alluring muse, Simone (Lea Seydoux), is both jailer and nude model. Typically, Anderson seems to see artists and news people as outside the pale in worlds peopled by freaks and citizens, high rollers and crooks, scolds and optimists.The French Dispatch has an ex-pat's sensibility with its romantic notions of Paris and the vagaries of daily life without the constant presence of gendarmes, a rose-colored reverie if you will. With the fourth episode, Tastes & Smells that tells of a Keystone Cops-like chase after kidnappers, Anderson lets us in on the less-romantic and more dangerous news profession.Leaving us with the sober but affecting ""Declines and Death"" elegy for the deceased editor, The French Dispatch has been a scattered romance about news reporting and our fanciful attachment to a mystical France. Don't try to fit the pieces together because they don't fit; the whole is a French impressionistic take on the whimsy of life, and nobody does whimsy better than Wes.",positive
"I like Adrian Brody and all the work he has done in the past. But this is his best piece of work since The Pianist. I think he has a great flair for comedy as well as being a fine dramatic actor; and he looks so much like Thomas Tafero. Del Toro is also excellent in one of his rare comedic turns, Swinton is always good, but Brody steals the film. Anderson has created a wonderful world that is both fantasy and realistic at the same time. I loved the pseudo-intellectual pandering and the patrons of the arts who will buy anything as long as you give them a good pitch. It is a film to be seen more than once, because it is highly unlikely you will catch all the satire the first time around.",positive
"I often do not agree with professional critics, but I have to concur with Vanity Fair, and NYTimes and others that this film We Anderson stumbles, and it is below average work compared to Anderson prior successes.Stylistically it certainly is apex-Anderson. And that is always enjoyable both in terms of admiring a craft well done and a reward for attentiveness to style. It does approach being finicky, almost cranky at times,. But not too far over the line.Unfortunately the film's core is a narrative jumble. Actually several narratives jumbled. I can only think this occurred in the editing room, perhaps with so much work there, that the director and editors start to forget that the audience is seeing the film for the first time and that the narratives on the first viewing has to make sense. Even breaking it into four vignettes makes it worse, not better. Look at the treatment of the James Baldwin character: Brilliant subject, brilliant actor, yet the character comes off as superficial.It is pretty clear Anderson loves The New Yorker of old, the Ross and Shawn eras before it dropped in quality in its evolution into a corporate controlled media in a conglomerate that includes Conde Nast. The real quality of the New Yorker is in its long form (for a magazine) fiction and non-fiction. In fact the modern New Yorker, with current editor Remnick using more reporters than noted writers, is part of the reason why its advertising has dropped, its audience aged, and its once famously unassailable fact checking now a caricature of former quality.But French Dispatch is *not* an homage to journalists, thank goodness. Anderson clearly mocks them as much as he lauds them. It is really an homage to France, specifically an American impression of France. (French critics have said Dispatch is patronizing, but we will leave that). It is the post-WWII France of the bicycle, baguette, Bardot and beret, albeit without nearly enough cigarettes. Not the 1930's era of Miller and Hemingway in Paris, unfortunately, as that would not have fit use of an American/The New Yorker point of view device. But the less interesting 1950's-60's period. Strangely enough with no detectable nod by Andersen to the most influential cultural export of the time -- French film.Overall Dispatch is a worthwhile viewing. Certainly for the technical adherence to Anderson's own single occupancy genre. The quirkiness has a bit of a forced element to it. But not artificial or crammed in, not overly so. The main problem is instead of turning pages, as one would do reading The New Yorker, there is more of a feeling of being in a labyrinth without Ariadne's thread, or a general disjointedness.7.5/10.",positive
"Deadpan pockmarked face, blank stare, monotone voice. If you like staring at a wall, that is basically what you get with Bill Murray. A whole lot of nothing. I enjoyed the French Dispatch until the dullness of Bill Murray ruined it.",negative
"Wes Anderson is back with another bizarre movie, and this time it's about three independent stories written for the last issue of a magazine, the French Dispatch.I don't watch a lot of Wes Anderson, but I love the Grand Budapest Hotel. His movies all have distinct editing style, frame, and especially color. To love Wes Anderson's filmography, you need to embrace the dream-like, surreal, yet beautiful looks of his movies.The French Dispatch took this to a more extreme level. The three stories were so damn weird that it was usually hard to follow. Characters retelling stories in messy order like they have ADHD, which kinda made sense because we usually say a lot of things when we are excited.Even though the stories were confusing, the look and editing were full on amazing. There were so many different editing styles that it's like a soup of color and unique camera shots. Some scenes made you look left, right, or corners at the same time (unless you know French).Overall, a magical looking movie that I'm sure Wes Anderson fans will love. 6.5/10.",positive
"If you know the style of Wes Anderson, this will be more of that.A moving diorama of actors acting odd for the sake of oddness. This is actually four stories in one about American ex-pats who write for a French paper.Everything is stylized in this film and works effectively. Watching the Benicio Del Toro story unfold is the most fun. The rest seem to be muddled in more pretention.One gets the feeling Wes just sits around like an overgrown child and makes vroom vroom noises as he drags a toy car on the carpet. This is quitessential Wes.Very well crafted.",positive
"If you aren't keen on Wes Anderson then give this film a wide berth as it is the most Wes Anderson film you could imagine.The characters are so well penned, all of them bringing something rich and quirky to the film. As you'd expect from the stellar cast they are all wonderfully portrayed. Every scene offers up about 3 or 4 cast members who either have been, should have been or will be Academy award winners. It really is something else.Like any Wes Anderson film the story is so unique, detailed, character driven and just bizarre. The French Dispatch boasts 3 separate stories which all offer something slightly different and are all so enjoyable to watch.Then there is the direction from Wes which is as you'd expect top notch. This film is just a feast for the eyes, with the colour pallete, the use of black and white in certain scenes, the framing, the camera work, the use of animation all fantastic. Everything is so Wes Anderson and so beautifully shot. I reckon you could pause this film at any given frame and end up with a brilliant canvas to hang on your wall.Absolutely brilliant and my favourite Wes Anderson to date.",positive
"The French Dispatch' consists of three main stories, so it is probably inevitable that one of them is less successful than the others. It is nothing to do with the actors concerned - principally Tilda Swinton, Benicio Del Toro, Adrien Brody and Léa Seydoux - simply that the story of an imprisoned artist becoming The Next Big Thing drags a bit. The other main segments - Frances McDormand and Timothée (still not sure how to pronounce that) Chalamet in a tale of student unrest; and Jeffrey Wright, Mathieu Amalric and Liev Schreiber caught up in a police operation including a kidnapped child and fine dining - are rollicking good fun.The conceit of these tales is they are all articles in the final issue of the 'French Dispatch', a supplement to a Kansas newspaper that brings French culture to the American Midwest. As the journalists tell their stories, the audience sees artistic pretentions and student naivety knowingly skewered. The acting is universally good and it would be hard to single out one performance - although how the whippet-thin Chalamet twice managed to deliver the line ""I'm embarrassed by my new muscles"" with a straight face is beyond me.The film is a mixture of black-and-white, colour and - in an inspired choice for a chase sequence - animation. Even the opening- and closing credits are entertaining (indeed, if there were an Oscar for best opening credits 'The French Dispatch' would win hands down). I saw this at the 2021 London Film Festival and will definitely watch it again - although possibly I will put on the kettle during the jailbird artist sequence.",positive
"This movies is rated as comedy. However, I couldn't find any scene ""funny"". The story, script & way of directing..... just very unique. Unfortunately, I couldn't understand his humor?",negative
"The French Dispatch is undeniably one of the most flat-out entertaining films I've seen in theatres so far in 2021, and this is coming from someone who isn't even a huge Wes Anderson fan. I typically find his movies to be quite cold - visually stunning, but emotionally distant - so imagine my surprise when I found myself entranced not only by this movie's remarkable visuals but also from its tender stories that depict the lovely, tragic, and unpredictable beauty of life.""The French Dispatch"" takes an anthology type approach to its plot that explores three unique stories and many unique characters. The ensemble cast that Anderson employs portrays a wide variety of characters that are a complete joy to watch; Timothée Chalamet as a cigarette enjoying wannabe revolutionary, Léa Seydoux as a soft-spoken but strong in conviction prison guard, Steve Park as a head chef who seems to believe that he has tasted all there is to taste - Anderson compiles a bizarre, relatable, and lovable, assortment of characters that all point toward the richness of individuality.From minute to minute, ""The French Dispatch"" is a celebration of reality, and an ode to people. I found the compilation of stories and portrayal of so many different types of people very life-affirming, and I certainly left the theatre in a better mood than I was when I entered it. I've read some reviews that state the film loses momentum after each story, but I disagree. I found each of the film's three stories equally as engaging - but even if you don't, I still believe you'll enjoy the overall experience of watching this film because of how beautiful it is to look at and hear.Anderson once again proves himself to have quite an eye for pleasing visuals. The film goes back and forth from color sequences to ones that play out in black and white, and regardless of if a certain scene is in color or not, every frame, shot, and sequence is bursting at the seams with style and flair and life - it literally felt like my eyes were eating up the scenery, and I can confidently say that I haven't seen a movie that looks this good in a long time. But Anderson also shows a masterful employment of music here that just enhances the visuals; one sequence in particular with Léa Seydoux walking past artwork, the scene going from black and white to color, with gorgeous music playing as Léa walks and admires, was simply stunning in its combination of sound, cinematography, and vibrant color.Listen, I don't really have much else to say because, simply put, I found ""The French Dispatch"" to be highly enjoyable. If you're not a fan of Wes Anderson you may be put off by his trademarked style, but then again, I'm not really a fan of his, and I found myself loving this movie from beginning to end. While walking into the theatre I was unsure if this movie would warrant a movie theatre experience, I can now say that I am very happy to have seen this on the big screen, and if you have any interest at all in seeing this, I encourage you to do the same.",positive
"I will admit that I had very high expectations for this film as soon as the first trailer dropped. It looked like it had the potential to be one of Wes Anderson's classics. Is it that? To be honest, I'm not quite sure because this film will 100% require repeat viewings for anyone to fully grasp everything going on in this film. I am also not sure that's a good thing.For me there is a lot going on in this film, maybe too much going on at once. In places throughout the film I did get a bit lost so much so that I started to lose interest ever so slightly. Now I know that having too much Wes (and his quirky/unique style) in one film, doesn't work all the time. There are story lines, aspects and characters that I really really enjoyed in this film. However there are also paths this film takes that aren't as interesting or rewarding as you think they would be.I am not trying to take away though from the incredible achievement this film is in terms or writing, directing and editing. I am telling you now, this film will be nominated for multiple awards this year......I have no doubt. The script for this film must have been one of the longest ever written. There is so much information packed into every single scene, interaction between characters and narration over the top. It is a lot to handle as an audience member but also makes you marvel at the sight of a technical genius, like Anderson, at work. I have a feeling this film is what it is like inside his brain hahaha. To have the imagination and vision to create this film is breath taking. All the complexities to the story along with the constant screen format changes, black and white to colour, time jumps and animation.......you name it, this film has it!The best parts of this film were some of the performances from this truly incredible huge cast. Benicio Del Toro, Adrien Brody and Timothee Chalamet are all absolutely phenomenal in this film !!! Also a shoutout goes to Lea Seydoux again another great role delivered from her!! The rest of them were all terrific as well however the ones mentioned above caught my eye more and jumped off the screen in the scenes they were in.Overall though I would say that I am slightly let down by this film because I know I missed so much information just viewing it the once. Should a film launch so much information at an audience at once it needs a second viewing to understand it all. (Some films get away with it, like Tenet because that is a spy, mystery, thriller....... I don't expect it nor think it works in a drama such as ""The French Dispatch""). Doesn't fit the genre for me.65% out 100, I thought that the film overall was ok/good, although I did start to get bored slightly because there was too much going on. Plus not all the story threads were as interesting. I think a second viewing would enhance my viewing pleasure, I am positive it will. That doesn't take away though from the phenomenal technical achievement this film is.",negative
"Every Wes Anderson trademark you could think of all told in a three story Anthology film. My personal favourite was the first story, and it never quite reached the heights of that one for me again. Shot beautifully and filled with quirky moments and humour as expected. I didn't emotionally connect with this as much as previous Wes Anderson's stuff, but still had a solid time with it and the time flew by. Performances were solid and the music was nice and melancholy. Got what I expected.7/10.",positive
"I've tried watching Wes Anderson's films. I've sat through most of them. And I still dislike him. The problem with his 'style', is that it's all that there is. The stories are bland, the characters are lame. If you like watching a movie that screams hipster and 'ain't I'm clever', then this the movie for you. Wes' movies are good for screenshots as computer desktop wallpaper, but taken as a whole, they leave you feeling empty and wondering why you wasted so much time.",negative
"With his signature aesthetic and uniquely quirky vibes, auteur Wes Anderson has established a devoted following of fans--one of which happens to be me. I also am a big fan of The New Yorker, which the film plays homage to, so I was very excited to see this delightfully Andersonian homage to French cinema and culture as well as journalism and literary magazines. Needless to say, it didn't disappoint, and I think Wes Anderson fans are going to love it. The film chronicles the last issue of an outpost of an American newspaper based in the fictional French city of Ennui-sur-Blasé. The vast majority of the film is an anthology of three chapters, which are bookended by a delightful-yet-fleeting opening and conclusion. The first chapter, ""The Concrete Masterpiece,"" tells the story of an artist incarcerated on murder charges whose paintings become a sensation. In the second chapter (""Revisions to a Manifesto,"") the relationship between a journalist and a revolutionary, anti-conscription leader is profiled. In the third and final chapter, ""The Private Dining Room of the Police Commissioner,"" an eccentric police investigation that ends up getting entangled with both an acclaimed chef and a kidnapping plot occurs.Anderson's visual style is beloved by his fans, and suffice it to say the aesthetics in ""The French Dispatch"" are nothing short of superb. From wide shots to panoramic shots to split-screen shots, the cinematography is wholly unique and engaging throughout the entire story. The film toggles seamlessly between color and black and white, and is always gorgeous to watch. Even a late-film traditionally animated sequence is creative and clever. There's plenty of humor on display here too, both of the deadpan variety and of clever one-liners and reveals similar to many of Wes Anderson's other films. Anderson does a great job of connecting the three main stories to the operation, purpose, and writing style of the newspaper--and this narrative ""connective tissue"" is, in many cases, a critical part of having a successful anthology. The film is consistently fun and engaging throughout for those with a clever and highbrow cinematic palette, and never wastes any time. Even though the film can occasionally feel a bit ""style-over-substance,"" the story's consistent message honoring the importance of journalists--particularly expat writers--and the unique literary and visual trends in great journalism that can affect readers ultimately comes off as pretty profound by the time the film reaches its conclusion. The film is definitely an ensemble piece, which has its pluses and minuses. The concern about the ensemble structure of the story's casting and characterization is that sometimes the character development can be a bit skimpy or derivative; however, given the strengths on display overall here and Anderson's clear filmmaking talent, that is a relatively minor complaint. I'm not sure if those who aren't fans of Wes Anderson will be won over by this (it is VERY ""Wes Anderson-y,"") but those of us who enjoy this superbly idiosyncratic filmmaker will have a blast. Gladly recommended. 8.5/10.",positive
"Wes Anderson has made two of my favorite movies - grand budapest hotel and royal tennenbaums but this unforgettable movie ranks near the bottom.The art and style is all there - a lot of tributes to the old french and italian cinema greats, to the silent movies back to meiles but what is missing is a cohesive compelling story.There is irony because you get 3-4 stories depending on how u look at it but nothing at all memorable or believable for a second.The writing is on the wall literally from the first scene when we are asked to indulge a joke that liberty, kansas (population 100) had a newspaper at one time with an office in paris. That alone was not enough to sink this movie - not with this great case of top notch actors.What is redeeming here is a few standout performances. If you hadnt seen benicio del toro before this movie is worth something because he shows again why he won the academy award 20 years ago for traffic. His eyes and facial expressions have a hint of lon chaney.Adrien brody hits the mark and does not disappoint- however the script undercuts him and does not do him justice.It seemed like they had jeffrey wright playing roebuck wright who seems to have been partially based on the writer richard wright though his story does not resemble Richard wrights character and frankly was quite the waste of time for the character who has the most lines in the movie.I know wes anderson likes to have his trademarks with these stories about how they always become unglued but this movie really took things to an extreme - there was almost literally no point to this nonsense.Add in some animation which he used in his boring movie isle of dogs- another sleeper and he completely lost me.A nude portrait scene was an example of the director's focus on the art crowd which nothing for me and not much to move the rather boring story.A scene involving an electric chair had some interesting metaphorical and symbolic value though that may have been just for shock value or laughs not sure.Three good scenes in the whole movie - a flashback scene paying tribute to Beau Geste (a three-second montage part of a larger flashback in the way royal tenenbaums does its ramones flashback scenes) an art scene and a quick shootout scene.This movie needed more great scenes - second story should have been cut out entirely.I gave it three stars - one start for art decoration, one star for the actors involved, and another star for the effort to pay tribute to the classic cinema.I cant give it more than three stars because that would be bad advice if you value your time and money. This movie is only going to appeal to the most loyal Wes Anderson fans and those overindulging in artistic self indulgence.This film overdosed on self indulgence.",negative
"Was expecting this one to be funny, but it turned out to be just a long boring movie with 3 unrelated storylines that am not sure what was their connection to the storyline, and the dialogue was rather hard to follow and comprehend, unless that was the intention. Acting and performance was good from all actors, music was good.",positive
"Using the artifact of multiple stories for a magazine, Wes Anderson glues together 3 stories set in a fictional French town in maybe the mid-20th century.The styles are all over the map. The stories themselves are shown in black-and-white, while action back in the U. S. is in color. One scene is done like a video of a stage play. Another sequence has an animated car chase. Then there is the language. I think the film should be either entirely in English, or have the French characters speak French to each other. However, there are characters who switch back and forth between languages, almost as an attempt to catch audience member napping.While all this is mildly interesting, it is also mildly irritating. This is mostly for Wes Anderson fans.",negative
"Someone already said it, it needs to be seem again as there is just so much content. So many actors had solid contributions in their limited roles. Seydoux was very hard NOT to look at when she was on the screen. However, you do need to be in the mood for this movie. It is like reading the New York Magazine. The NYM is a fun read when you're anticipating all the news, quirks and puns they deliver so you need the same mindset for this movie.",positive
"Mr. Anderson is one of my all time favorite directors, having made some of my very favorite and beloved films. This one has its charms.. and its moments. It's a collage of separate stories being covered by different American ex-pat journalists living in France, working for Bill Murray (who instead of going to New York and starting the New Yorker, went to France). The best of these is the Benicio Del Toro/Adrien Brody contribution, which I found riveting and moving and all that it could be. Overall, the film is intelligent - yes, certainly. However, there is a level of pretention and condescension that is really not enjoyable. I think I have come to expect something known from Mr. Anderson - true heart and soul in what may otherwise seem vapid or angry (or otherwise one dimensional) characters, humour, pathos, and something bright - something that gets the serotonin running.. bright colours, bright feelings - something ultimately uplifting. Maybe it's not fair of me to expect more of the same. The artist has to grow and has the right to create.. but as the consumer, I can feel a little disappointed when the flavour is just a bit off. And yet, I would recommend this file and I certainly don't regret seeing it.",positive
"It is up its own ass, in the practice that characterizes most of Anderson's oeuvre, and it has sort of a chaotic momentum that is hard to follow. But as someone who is generally a fan of his filmmaking style, I still liked it, even though it is decidedly not among his best.",positive
"I saw the trailer for this animated movie a couple of times in the cinema, it looked like it would be a good laugh, and Mark Kermode gave it a positive review, so I was more than up for seeing it. Basically, in the future, tech giant Bubble unveils its latest creation: the B-Bot. Created by the generous CEO Marc Weidell (Justice Smith), it is a robotic buddy designed to help make friends and connect to the internet. In the town of Nonsuch, middle school student Barney Pudowski (Jack Dylan Grazer) is the only one in school who does not own a B-Bot. His former childhood friends, Savannah Meades (Kylie Cantrall), Rich Belcher (Ricardo Hurtado), Noah (Cullen McCarthy) and Ava (Ava Morse) have all become absorbed by their individual B-Bots. Barney's father Graham (Ed Helms), who sells novelty items online, and his grandmother Donka (Olivia Colman) come to realise that Barney does not have any friends and empathise with him. They hastily go to a Bubble store, but it is closes as they arrive. Fortunately, a delivery driver has a slightly damaged B-Bot that had fallen out of his truck and sells it to them. Barney wakes the day after his birthday and is overjoyed to receive a B-Bot (Zach Galifianakis) as a late birthday present. But upon activating it, quickly learns that it is defective and glitchy. Not wanting to upset his father, he decides to take it back to the Bubble store to get it fixed. He runs into Rich and his friends who taunt and try to humiliate him. The B-Bot begins to fight back, as his safety functions are not active, and he and Barney laugh together and run. Rich calls the police and Barney and the B-Bot, along with Graham and Donka, are taken to the Bubble store so that the B-Bot can be crushed. Not wanting to see him go, Barney secretly rescues the B-Bot, and names him Ron, a shortened version of his model number. Barney and Ron's actions are reported. While Marc is happy to see Ron go against his programming, his chief operating officer Andrew Morris (Rob Delaney) sees it as bad publicity for the company. They believe Ron has been destroyed and that the issue has been resolved. Barney teaches Ron how to be a good friend, with various notes posted on a wall to store in his memory. While hanging out, they run into Savannah who tells Ron that he needs to help Barney get friends. Despite Barney telling Savannah not to, she posts Ron's actions online, alerting Bubble. The next day, Ron leaves the house and tries to get ""friends"" for Barney, bringing a series of random strangers to school. While Barney gets into trouble, Rich discovers Ron's unlocked function and downloads it, causing all the other B-Bots to have their safety features and parental controls turned off. The B-Bots run wild, connecting and forming for a moment into a large robot creature. The B-Bot creature swallows and excretes (poops out) Savannah, this moment is filmed and shared across social media, and she is publicly humiliated. When the chaos eventually dissolves Barney is suspended from school. Andrew warns Marc about the ramifications of the B-Bot and sends their entire team of employees to find and get rid of Ron. Marc sneaks away so that he can meet Ron. Following his suspension, Barney tells Ron off whilst returning home, but he realises Ron was truly being a friend. Barney eventually forgives Ron's actions, and realises that Bubble employees are coming for him, and decides to run away with him. They briefly run into Savannah, still upset over her incident, and tells her that he is hiding in the woods. Barney and Ron initially enjoy themselves but end up lost in the woods and spending a scary, uncomfortable night there. At school, the B-Bots have been put under heavy lock and Savannah confides in Rich that they were indirectly responsible for Barney's situation. Bubble uses their resources, hacking into other B-Bots to take control and search for Ron and Barney. They manage to hide from them, but the cold weather and Barney's asthma have caused him to become weak. Ron brings Barney back to civilisation just outside the school where Savannah, Rich, Noah, and Ava rush out to help him. Barney is taken to the hospital and recuperates, before meeting Marc who is impressed with Ron. Marc fixes Ron's glitches and thereby makes him a different B-Bot. But Barney wants Ron's original personality back, but Marc says he is locked out from the cloud. Andrew has taken over the company, and the only place to find Ron's memory is to access the cloud at Bubble's headquarters. Barney, Graham, Donka, and Marc break into Bubble HQ to rescue Ron. Through an elaborate plan, Barney manages to make it to the Bubble database and finds Ron's original data and uploads him back into his body. Seeing that Bubble has direct access to everyone's B-Bot and realising that everyone is just as lonely as he was, Barney has the idea to upgrade all B-Bots to have Ron's flaws. But this means that Ron will be dispersed into the internet. Barney reluctantly says goodbye to Ron as his programming is spread to everyone. Andrew is disgraced in front of a crowd of people after Marc secretly recorded him admitting that the B-Bots spy on their owners for profit, and Marc is reinstated as Bubble CEO. Three months later, everyone has a faulty B-Bot, but are happy with their wild and weird personalities. Barney no longer has a B-Bot but has become much more sociable and become close with his former friends. As they hang out at recess, a giant Bubble tower overlooking Nonsuch produces Ron's face, implying that he is still alive. Also starring Marcus Scribner as Alex, Thomas Barbusca as Jayden, Sarah Miller as Bree, and Ruby Wax as Ms Hartley, with additional voices by Liam Payne and Phil LaMarr. The voice casting is very good, from Galifianakis as the cute, damaged robot friend constantly calling Barney ""Absalom"", to Colman as the eccentric grandmother and Delaney as the profit-obsessed villain. It is a clever story about friendship, Ron the Tic Tac shaped Weeble-like robot with all functions of a mobile phone that can think for itself and its protocols to keep it safe not working is a wonderful character, his glitches make for some really funny moments, but there is also cute and heart-warming stuff, and it also satirises the world of social networking and harvesting data, this really is a film for all the family to enjoy, a terrific and fun computer-animated fantasy comedy. Very good!",positive
"I'm going to start my review with a moan. Since when was it OK for parents to just let their young children chat throughout a film at a cinema? Or to wander about the aisles dropping popcorn everywhere? My parents would have had a fit, and we would have been unceremoniously removed never to return. Cinema is a shared experience on a big screen, not a surrogate baby-sitting service! Phew, now I have got that off my chest, this is quite a thought-provoking animation. The premiss is nothing especially new, a toy that every kid must have (remember the ""Cabbage Patch Doll?"") but this story has a far more sinister undertone to it. ""Marc"" is the bright-eyed, enthusiastic, young CEO of ""Bubble"" and in best Steve Jobs tradition, addresses his huge team from the ""launchatorium"" announcing their newest product - the ""B-bot"". A small, egg-shaped, gadget that is to become the best friend of every child. It will befriend them, know all about them, manage their social media accounts - do just about everything except eat for them. Soon, every kids wants one , has one - and they have become the norm. Except, that is, for ""Barney"" who lives with his father and his totally bonkers grandma, and whose dad is concerned that kids live too much of their lives vicariously through gadgets. Like so many parents, though, peer pressure ultimately forces their hand - and they buy him one on the black market (well, yes, it literally did fall off the back of a lorry!). It hasn't been pre-programmed like the gazillions of others, and so he ""Ron"" and ""Barney"" actually have to learn how to get to know one another. That's the source of many a light-hearted escapade as they begin to like, understand and trust each other whilst the boffins want to reclaim their errant android and squish him up before their share price goes the way of the dodo! The animation is colourful and well designed, and there is a smidgen of humour too, to keep the film moving along quickly and entertainingly. There are certainly quite a few poignant aspects to this: it does write large the worrying expansive culture of popularity, of always keeping up with - or surpassing - your frequently quite shallow (virtual) friends; and of the damage - both physical and psychological - that can be caused when these things go wrong. Also, it swipes fairly and squarely at corporate exploitation and greed - especially when it is directed at children, and at the laziness of the grown-ups who submit, meekly, to anything that makes life easier or less complicated, without the slightest awareness or appreciation of the potential consequences. The ending is a little bit cheesy, i felt - but there is entertainment a-plenty here with quite a strong message for those who paid for the tickets.",positive
"I saw Ron's Gone Wrong, starring the voices of Jack Dylan Grazer-Shazam!, the It movies; Zach Galifianakis-A Wrinkle in Time, What Happens in Vegas; Ed Helms-Chappaquiddick, the Hangover movies and Olivia Colman-The Crown_tv, Hot Fuzz.This is an animated movie that is basically a commentary on social media and how it affects kids. Jack is a middle school kid that is not very popular-he has no friends. A new personal robot-called 'bots'-is the new cell phone for the younger generation and every kid wants one. With these bots, they can text, talk, send videos & pictures.....etc. And they are a sign of status. They are marketed as being the new best friend to their juvenile owners. Jack does not have one. He keeps asking his father, Ed, for one and when he finally gets one, it is damaged and causes lots of back and forth struggles between it and Jack on their journey to find the true meaning of friendship. Zach voices the damaged bot, Ron and Olivia voices Jack's grandmother.It's rated PG for crude material and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 46 minutes.I enjoyed it enough to buy it on DVD and the younger kids should enjoy it, too.",positive
". . . blows the whistle upon Macro Hard Face Goo. RON'S GONE WRONG postulates that even if a benign genius thinker is among the founders of an incipient major social network or software corporation, irredeemable mercenary crooks inevitably will find a way to force the brains behind innovation OUT of the concern, and take the whole shebang over to the Dark Side. As has been documented in countless Sixty Minutes segments, news articles and books--sometimes with the cooperation of defecting corporate whistleblowers--this is EXACTLY what has happened time after time during the past few decades with the Real Life Lucifers now running Macro Hard Face Goo. How sad!",negative
"LIKES:Great Pace: Animated movies always fluctuate with balance issues and their gimmicks, often executing well and sometimes tipping one way over the other. Ron's Gone Wrong starts with a good pace that moves to be fun and engaging for younger audiences, but not so much to skip the deeper messages lying in wait. The movie handles transitions between the acts very well, each one having a decent amount of time, sticking to a realistic timeline, and still moving to never get lost in any gimmicks. It's a major source of the fun for me, and should be able to hold the fleeting attention of the modern generation.Animation: It's not realistic, it's not groundbreaking, and it's not the most unique pallet to paint on, however Ron's group is certainly fun, cute, and animated well to bring the story to life. Ron's tale has a lot of dynamic movement between the robots that plague the world and the humans who use them and both elements are done extraordinarily well. Younger audiences should welcome the bubbly, rounded features of the world, and even the ""darker"" aspects are shaded to be less imposing for more sensitive viewers. Nevertheless, the dynamic stunts and adventures are gorgeous and filled with emotion as the more intense moments hit.The Voice Acting: Nothing that hits the Oscar category, but certainly well done nonetheless to get the characters alive and past the simple digital representation. Jack Dylan Grazer hits the vulnerable teen well, a mixture of confusion and hurt that gradually evolves into a more mature role as the movie moves on past the simple adventure. Ed Helms is still excelling at the antagonistic role, and works well in the enunciation and mannerisms that seem to match the character on screen making for a simplistic character to throw a wrench in the gears. The star is Galifianakis though, whose voice of Ron is sensationally casted for the quirky robot struggling to boot up and perform his coding. Ron's style takes the ridiculousness of the actor, but manages to curb it into something tolerable and PG rated that works to be humorous. Even better, he also lends to more emotional moments, managing to never lose the robotic tone and delivery, and yet somehow instilling emotion to the level.The Presentation: The movie is wonderful for helping to really deliver the powerful punches that the movie is trying to execute. The first two acts manage to be focused on the buildup, giving you the hurt and sting of the protagonist and the family's attempts to help him adapt into the new world. It's balanced between fun and drama, keeping a pace that is inviting to the attention of all ages. Then the third act starts to really dive into the fun, never dropping the drama or suspense, but focusing on the subtle moral lessons while keeping the fun. Then it's the final two acts that start to play around with the balance, never eliminating one or the other, but adding the tweaks to again get that presentation going. I loved the designs and close ups of those key moments, while utilizing other things like sound, music, and simple change of perspective to capture all of the moments needed.The Comedy: Not the cleverest, and really not the most spread, but something about Ron's charm manages to make elements of the movie very funny for adults. Sure there is kid humor, all about using slap stick and quotable lines to have your little ones giggling in delight. Ron's lines in particular are reminiscent of technology gone wrong, mixed with childlike innocence and wonder, and mixed with just enough sarcasm and blunt humor to be very entertaining. Slapstick moments arise decently, and other elements integrated into the mix with other characters will touch other comedy moments lightly. It works well with the theme, being a staple without overcoming the other elements and I enjoyed it even if I was not on the floor laughing the whole time.The Story/Morals: This is probably the strongest thing I latched onto in this movie, the story and the lessons tied with it. Barney's tale is relevant to this reviewer, not only in personal experiences, but in approaches to the modern trends and way of life that the last 7 years has brought. Feeling the social life being lost to the technology life is tough, and Barney's caught in between both that are combatting for the dominance in the world. Upon Ron's emergence, this tale really tries to highlight things that I think are important and what I try to do, which touches a lot of my heart strings and brought the fun out of the movie. As the relationship between the two protagonists evolves, the directors and animators try to up the game and in many senses I think hit the check boxes for that emotional punch we all need in these movies. Especially the ending where the climactic collision of all the stories works together to really deliver the finale we have been looking forward to all this time.DISLIKES:Predictable: I never expected this to be the case of a surprise, but you always hope for something to blow your mind with these movies. In this case, the movie is very linear and predictable, taking suspense away because of how much I knew was coming. For most, this won't be an issue if they are having fun, but as a reviewer there is a little bit of tweaking to help get the story to engage to older audiences past the target audience age. Some plot holes also can get in the way of things at times, primarily when logic and security tend to be easily subverted to get the job done.The Character Usage: I'm mixed on this because in truth they did do a nice job keeping many characters in the film, it's just that some of them really get dropped despite the hints they do in one scene. The climax suggested there would be a lot more involvement with some of the other kids and their talents, but that did not happen, and they were mostly used for some political moments rather than ingraining them into the tale. They are used quite powerfully, but I can't say that there is room for improvement to assist with the better development with some of the group.Ron can be a bit annoying: This is a small tweak definitely, but the I have to admit that there are times when Ron's antics are a little too much. Primarily at the beginning when Barney is trying to get him set up, the writers tended to stray into the realm of a few jokes too far. It gets mitigated much more down the line, but there are a few times of going down the kid avenue over the adult humor.The Comedy: Not perfect, but Ron's Gone Wrong could have used a little more adult humor to bring the adults in further. Again, it does not mean it has to go down the levels of derogatory humor, but 90's television and Shrek has proven you can be a little bolder with comedy and hide it from the kids. I would have liked that very much for helping break some things up instead.The Politics: Yes, there is unfortunately some political preachiness in this film, and to the point of being a little in your face. However, I have to say it's not promoting the usual manners and was more acceptable than some of the other films I've seen in the past (looking at you Charlie's Angels 2019). But, the messages in Ron's about friendship vs. Technology may rub people the wrong way depending on which way you swing in the era of Social Media vs Social Networking with people. I think Ron does a nice job mitigating it if you stick with it, but it can be hard given some of the in your face symbolism and lines. This may be the part that will drive more people away, primarily due to the challenges of change and taking steps back from technology that can get in the way of fun.The VERDICT: Ron's Gone Wrong may not be the movie of the year for Academy Awards compared to movies like Soul. Yet this movie should not be ignored or destroyed because it does not go down the ""progressive"" or unique edge in terms of what Disney can do. However, the movie has a lot of heart to it, really exploring avenues that socially awkward people like myself can learn, take comfort in, and hopefully get some lessons to others for surviving in this world. I loved the buddy comedy, had a blast with the pacing and design, and really felt some great moments in the story piece of the film. True, there are plot gaps and predictability, and the character usage is a bit lacking, leaning towards woke symbolism and hyperbole than true integration. In addition, there are also some heavy handed preaching components that my generation and onward may be turned off on given the approach to life we take. Yet, Ron's journey is a lot of fun, and really does a nice job of walking a balanced line of fun, story, and lessons that I really think is not being represented in the advertising and reviews. Thus, this movie I encourage people to take a look at and potentially be surprised and entertained like I was. My scores for this film are:Animated/Adventure/Comedy: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0.",positive
"Ron: ""Are you my best friend?"" Oh damn.Being alone in the theater was a blessing because I was able to laugh out loud with this one. The story was super formulaic with concrete acts and turning points. The theme was nothing new and felt redundant.However, I adored the relationship between the main kid Barney and the malfunctioning bebot Ron. They cracked me up multiple times. The more I watched, the more I became invested in their relationship.Overall, it's a movie that you have seen many times before, but the strong and sweet relationship between the two main characters made this worth a watch. 7.5/10.",positive
"Ron's Gone Wrong is a good presentation letter from the animation company Locksmith Animation. The script revolves around friendship and the digital world, the result is pleasant, a positive message that sometimes feels contradictory or implausible (a final act not necessary), but the story does its job. The animation is very good, being quite successful, in the future Locksmith Animation will have a great place in the world of animated cinema.",positive
"I'm old enough to remember artificial intelligence being questioned. ""Short Circuit"", for example, tackled this idea long before it could even be acknowledge. And for the most part, it gave the more positive spin to inanimate objects learning to be ""more human"" ""Short Circuit"" didn't shy from wanting Johnny 5 to have a soul. Ron is perfectly fine staying a program that attempts to save itself in the final 10 minutes of the film.In this case, Ron is a programmed A. I. that is designed to be more of a information analyzer. Or at least absorb everything about a middle school aged child and reguritate the idea of being a friend. A solid concept, to be sure.Where Ron goes wrong is that there is a LOT of misplaced judgement of the future. For instance, a very sophisticated bot being all things to everyone, all the time. We see these as an extension pet of a child but never do see these in the hands of adults. Alexa and Siri would be insulted. Here it monitors all activity and uses an algorithm to pretend to be a friend. Much like Teddy Ruxpin, in terms of a sense of interaction. But never really engaged.So of course we need a hip young mind to promote and program such a thing and a money grubbing Steve Jobs like character to play the villain to exploit such a miracle. Ron is the outlier. A broken beaten bot whose malfunction will obviously give him the insight needed to change things. It does get tedious. Mostly because we know what the issues are. The preaching of tech being evil has run its course. As I'm sure the makers had their hearts in the right place. Tech was made to better our lives but made us much more distant. The movie offers no solution. Only a glimpse that we need to re-focus our reliance of using tech to be less distant to humanity. Small steps, I suppose.A mid-range look at these things. Especially when Barney (lead characters) world of humanity consists of a nebbish father and a annoying grandmother.",positive
"2021 PG director: Sarah Smith and Jean Phillipe Divine.Starring: Jack Dylan Grazer, Zach Galifianakis, Ed Helms, Olivia Colman, Rob Delaney, Justice Smith, Kylie Cantrall, Ricardo Hurtado etcThe story of Barney, an awkward middle-schooler and Ron, his new walking, talking, digitally connected device. Ron's malfunctions set against the backdrop of the social media age launch them on a journey to learn about true friendship. Ron's gone wrong was ok and fine for what it was.My first few positives would be the strong animation and set up. As well as the great worldbuilding and interesting elements. Also, the likeable characters, humour, and interesting family dynamic. The film was visually stunning with a rich storyworld and aesthetically pleasing set locations, also with impressive animation for the characters that looked realistic but also unique to some other animations. I also thought the set-up of introducing the B bots and what their function were intrigued me and was a strong start to the film. The worldbuilding itself was also strong, with the film going into great amounts of details about the b bots and their function and building and expanding on the world with the character or Ron, it had layers to it and didn't feel one dimensional so was always invested in the world the characters were in. I also thought the characters were very likeable. Barney had this loveable charm to him as a character and he was easy to sympathise and connect with and I feel like his character can be relatable to a lot of people watching. Especially younger kids who perhaps feel the same as his character. I also loved the family dynamic. Him losing his mother and never building the relationship with his dad gave some interesting themes and depth, and the comedic chemistry with the grandmother was always fun to watch. The films humour especially with the grandmother and the weird and wonderful situations Barney got into with Ron got some good laughs.My first few negatives are the generic plot elements. The repetitive humour and forced dialogue. As well as the pacing issues. The film recycled a lot of plot points and themes from other movies and this kind of movie has been done before and done better. A film like the Mitchell's vs the machines comes to mind. I also thought not all the humour landed. The film was inconsistent and went very repetitive with some of the jokes. They lost their impact after a certain number of times and it became slightly tedious and annoying hearing the same joke multiple times. I also thought a lot of the dialogue felt very corny and forced. Particularly with a lot of the characters and how they interact with Barney. It just felt very unrealistic and generic with why the kids were being mean to him and the dialogue shined a light on this. I also thought the pacing was very messy. The film was too chaotic and was moving at such a fast pace but with a surprising lack of plot. So, it missed opportunities for more depth as it constantly wanted to move onto new things and just threw everything at you, so it lacked focus.My final few positives would be the strong themes and charming tone. As well as the chemistry between the characters and heart-warming moments. And the villain was strong with an entertaining and uplifting final act. I think the themes on friendship and family, as well as making relationships in the real world and not creating a fake version of yourself was strong and very important. This film also had a very charming tone, the chemistry and friendship between Ron and Barney was very sweet as they grew their friendship and they both learned from each other, and it was a heart-warming highlight of the film. They both had such a great chemistry with each other and as Ron learned more about Barney the more emotionally connected Barney felt to something as he grew to accept himself. I also thought the villain was strong, the themes that the villain helped highlight were strong. Highlighting the need for security and controlled screen time especially when they are kids, and how horrible the villain was with the invasion of the kid's privacy helped to highlight this. Finally, I thought the final act was uplifting and entertaining. The final act was the strongest part of the film for me. It was heart-warming with Barney finally feeling accepted and his arc with his family was very touching and well done. It was entertaining and visually stunning and offered a great message that ended the film on a high note.My final few negatives would be the lack of development and stakes. As well as the odd character decisions. For me the film really lacked any plot or development for a good chunk of the run time. It felt like it was more of a series repetitive plot points that weren't going anywhere. And with a lack of a strong villain until the second half, for a while the film just wasn't going anywhere. This impacted the pacing and the quality of the writing. There was also just a complete lack of stakes, there was no real sense of danger for a large portion of the film, it felt like it wasn't challenging itself or the characters enough, therefore limiting the amount of development the plot and characters could have. I also thought that there were some odd creative decisions with the characters. I found it very strange that the film spent so long having characters like Savannah and Rich bully Barney for so long, only for them to suddenly be friends with him, it just felt very odd and I found it hard to believe the characters would change their point of view on each other so quickly.Overall, Ron's gone wrong has strong animation, A loveable lead duo. And raises some good themes, its heart was in the right place. But the thinly written and recycled plot as well as a general feeling of playing it too safe impacted my enjoyment considerably. It was serviceable and families will enjoy it, but I don't think I will be watching it again.Overall rating 62/100.",negative
"I really enjoyed this film, the characters are good, and cross over well for adult viewers, and the plot is modern and quite on point.The film is funny, absorbing and goes at a good pace.All I found odd was the main company in the film was obviously aimed at a certain technology company and the villain in the film seemed to be directly aimed at a a person who has long passed away and was not a villain in most people's eyes.",positive
"Kids nowadays are so into device & social media. This movie will definitely show the kids what is real friendship in life! However, the animation is just so so.",negative
"Although it is treated here through a modern and contemporary approach, a topic like friendship and acceptance of others is timeless and always current. It is clear that modern technology is emphasized here, so it seems relevant. The film has a few good moments and jokes that made me laugh. Maybe it takes a little too long for the kids and some scenes probably needed to be shortened so it would last shorter and get on quality. The lesson of the film is a good, solid film for children.",positive
"The premise of this movie is promising, but as it progresses, the plot becomes very boring and tedious.The constant change of the conflict to be resolved makes the film boring and tedious, it wants to give several messages, among them the one that the new generations are becoming addicted to technology and that this blinds them about human contact, which contradicts itself with The end of the movie. It wants to imply that social networks and technology companies can steal our privacy, but I think the message is directed towards parents not to introduce their children to technology from an early age. Other things do not finish materializing, such as the message of feeling belonged and lonely, or that a friend can be totally different from you. The film is full of conveniences that favor the protagonist. The highlights are the animation and the development of some characters.The film fails when trying to convey many messages through many subplots that do not finish materializing, just as I think this film could seem a bit boring for children, although it can be a bit emotional due to the theme of friendship.",negative
"People are addicted to the internet specifically teenagers and this movie shows it here. People aren't playing with friends as they are to buisy playing with there robots where they can go live and show the world what they are doing. Ron was a funny robot and I loved how his character was written. The overall story is Ok but it is important to are society. The boy's dad wants him to make friends and play with them instead of playing on technology like Phones as an E.g. The story is also original and theres a few good laughs. It was a nice day out with my family my 1 brother he was only one that came out of the other 2 and then my annoying sister 😂, and My dad and we all had fun. So take your family and enjoy it I promise you will enjoy it more.",positive
"So this is very interesting, there is a recent animation studio that goes by the name of LockSmith Animation, founded by Sarah Smith who directed Arthur Christmas, so this is should be a good film to start off this studio and see what they are capable of, this just came out yesterday in the UK and I got a chance to see it today with high hopes! And..., yeah it was good, a good film that is indeed a good start, but now without a few minor complaints, so let's talk about it.First off the animation is quite impressive, there is a certain style and colour to it that looks rather extraordinary, the characters have a distinct cartoony design to them that I quite admire, the textures are nicely rendered, the B*Bots are wildly creative in how they look and move, it's very impressive and quite imaginative, I like the music too especially Henry Jackman's score and the song Sunshine by Liam Payne, the characters are easy to like even if they are cliched stereotypes, especially Ron (Zach Galifianakis) who is lovable and Barney (Jack Dylan Grazer) who is relatable in every way, thanks to the very solid voice acting, they carry the comedy and the drama rather well also, the story does have it's good heart and even stronger comedy, with also sweet moments that are quite admirable like i was surprised by how funny this film was, the film does get even more interesting and the steaks get bigger as it goes along, I like the ending a lot as it does fulfil the film's concept and message.However there are a couple of things that are as wrong as Ron, like the movie has quite the cliches in it's story and it's quite predictable for the most part, that and the animation looks very similar to something like Arthur Christmas (hence Sarah Smith's involvement) heck Barney looks like him and Andrew (Rob Delaney) looked like Steve and Ron looked like Baymax, it also looks similar to Mitchells Vs. The Machines not just because of Olivia Colman's Involvement, the bully character can be annoying at times, also there are a few moments of very poor attempts to make fart jokes funny and it still doesn't work, I don't get it..., it's not very funny.So yeah I did enjoy this movie for quite a bit and it was a good start for this animation studio, Ron's Gone Wrong is a enjoyable family animated feature that anyone can watch of any age, with it's impressive animation, a nice heart and message, a decently written story, likeable enough characters, very good voice acting, great comedy and a cool concept, but the silly moments of toilet humour, as to be expected cliches and easy to predict story doesn't give this film quite the magnum opus that LockSmith needs in a way, it's still a good animated movie that I can see everyone enjoying and remembering, but hey it's not perfect, so check it out when it comes out in the US, I certainly wish the best of luck to Locksmith for more potentially great animated features in the future!I'm going to give Ron's Gone Wrong a 7.9/10.",positive

"It's been a rough start for 20th Century Studios for both the beginning of 2020 and 2021, especially with the closer of their primary animation department Blue Sky Studios. They haven't really made too many animated features since the release of Blue Sky's last animated feature ""Spies in Disguise"". Fortunately, their newest animated feature, ""Ron's Gone Wrong"", gave way to a whole new era of animation for the studio. This is perhaps one of their finest works yet, featuring stylish animation, funny humor, and heartwarming moments, particularly between the titular character and his human owner.Set in the future, the film tells the story of Barney Pudowski, an awkward middle school student who has no friends whatsoever. He ends up getting a B-Bot named Ron for his birthday, but it does not work well, as it is defective and had fallen out of the back of a delivery truck. Now Ron and Barney have to work together to uncover the true meaning of friendship and find a way to fix Ron before he is discovered and crushed by the owners of the company that made him, Bubble. The story is so well-paced and full of heartwarming moments, as well as some consistently funny humor.I love Barney and Ron's relationship in this movie. It's so genuine and full of emotional scenes, as well as some very nuanced character interactions. Plus Ron's malfunctioning personality makes him beyond entertaining. The other characters in the movie, especially Savannah Meades, provide lots of depth into the movie's story, and build up relationships with the two main protagonists.The animation of this movie is very stylish and crafty. Locksmith Animation, the studio behind the feature, put all their blood, sweat, and tears into making this feature, and they did a fantastic job with the visuals and character designs.I also love how there aren't too many nods to popular apps in this movie, instead having fictional apps used for the B-Bots. That's what's most interesting about this technology-based film.Even though it will not quite capture the spirit of this year's ""The Mitchells vs. The Machines"" movie, ""Ron's Gone Wrong"" is still an entertaining coming-of-age movie that is true to its story and characters, and has the heart in the right place.",positive
Took my 8 year old son and he gives it a 6.Basically he thought Ron was mostly annoying (so did I) and not particularly funny. He definitely did not have any desire to have a Ron (a broken b bot) but was more interested in one of the functioning ones. So the totally unoriginal message here definitely did not make any impact on him. He mostly enoyed it though.. hence the 6.I personally thinks he's spot on in his judgement of Ron. Why Barney laughs at or enjoys any of the extremely annoying stuff Ron does in the movie beats me. I would also prefer one of the functioning ones.I'll chip on also to add that the story is 80% unoriginal and 100% predictable. This could only be made in the US. I would give a 4 - but since this is primarily a kids movie I'll let my son Oscar provide his score!,negative

"Greetings again from the darkness. Every once in a while a movie captures that magic feeling of being swept away, and this wild film from writer-director Edgar Wright and co-writer Kristy Wilson-Cairns (1917) did just that for me. This is my kind of psychological-horror-thriller and with the exception of one sequence that went a bit too ""slasher"" for my tastes, I had a blast watching it. I'll admit that, while also acknowledging more people will probably not enjoy this, than will. But for those who do, I feel confident they will share my enthusiasm.Eloise (Thomasin McKenzie, JOJO RABBIT, 2019) opens the film by expressively dancing to Peter & Gordon's ""A World Without Love"" while sporting a self-designed dress made of perfectly creased newspaper. Her room is filled with 1960's colors and memorabilia and we soon learn she's an orphan raised by her grandmother (Rita Tushingham, A TASTE OF HONEY, 1961). Eloise, or Ellie as she's called, dreams of following her mother's path to London, and is thrilled beyond measure when her acceptance letter arrives from the London School of Fashion. Ellie does carry the burden (and visions) of her mother's mental illness, and her grandmother warns, ""London can be a lot."" Small town (Cornwall) Ellie with her timidity and wide-eyed innocence arrives in London and is immediately the target of 'mean girl' and fellow student Jocasta (Synnove Karlsen). Rather than subject herself to the abuse, Ellie sublets an attic room from an old lady landlord named Mrs. Collins (the last screen appearance for the great Diana Rigg). Ellie loves the room and her independence, but her dreams act as a portal back to those swinging 60's of which she's so fond. But that's only the beginning. It's here where she follows/becomes Sandie (Anya Taylor-Joy), and the mirror effects are truly other-worldly. Sandie is everything that Ellie wishes she was herself - confident, radiant, ambitious, and beautiful. This dream state allows Ellie to live vicariously through Sandie. At least initially.The Ellie-Sandie sequences mess with your head in a wonderful way. Sandie seems to float across the club's dance floor, and Ellie is mesmerized at first, before turning protective. The tone shifts when Sandie meets sleazy Jack (Matt Smith), a would-be agent who promises to get Sandie the shot at stardom she desires. This leads to ATJ's amazing and breathy version of Petula Clark's ""Downtown"". It's a standalone highlight of the film, and a moment that shifts the story yet again. If you are struggling to keep pace, you're not alone.Soho's glamour is matched only by its grunge. The recurring dreams turn to nightmares, so that even Ellie's waking hours are surreal. A mysterious elderly gent played by Terence Stamp may be the key to the mystery Ellie's so busy trying to solve that she is oblivious to the romantic overtures by nice guy John (Michael Ajao). The nostalgia of the 60's provides a visual treat with the Café de Paris, a massive theater marquee advertising James Bond's THUNDERBALL, and Cilla Black's ""You're My World"".Filmmaker Wright gives us so much to discuss, but it's crucial that the best parts not be spoiled. Just know that Oscar winner Steven Price (GRAVITY, 2013) provides an incredible mix of music, while Chung-Hoon Chung's cinematography, Marcus Rowland's Production Design, and Odile Dicks-Mireaux's costumes all nearly steal the show. But of course, that can't possibly happen thanks to the stupendous performances from Anya Taylor-Joy and (especially) Thomasin McKenzie. These are two of the finest young actors working today, and we will be fortunate to watch their careers develop.Edgar Wright is having quite a year. He's already delivered the terrific documentary, THE SPARKS BROTHERS, and now comes what is his best work yet. You may know his work on BABY DRIVER (2017) or the Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy that kicked off with SHAUN OF THE DEAD (2004). Here, he playfully bounces between genres serving up time travel, a murder mystery, the Soho history, a memorable soundtrack, surreal dream and ghost sequences, a touch of romance, and that previously mentioned 'slasher' scene. A final tip of the cap to Diana Rigg, whose career spanned her role as Emma Peel in ""The Avengers"" (from the 60's), her time as a Bond girl in ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE (1969), and ultimately as Olenna Tyrell in ""Game of Thrones"".Opens in theaters on October 29, 2021.",positive
"Director Edgar Wright has made one interesting and tense glamour like suspense thriller horror like drama in ""Last Night in Soho"". Maybe he took from a page of old classic horror and he really blended the film well with 60's culture of clothes, music and hair styles. The acting and chemistry between the two leads Anya Taylor Joy and Thomasin Mckenzie is in top form.The story and setting is with Eloise a girl who's lost her mother and she is being raised by grandma and she's accepted to a fashion design school in London. So it's off to the big bright lights and city streets and she does not fit in the click with the current class of girls. So she rents an apartment and her landlady just doesn't seem right. Soon Eloise starts having strange dreams seeing a past time in nightclubs of the 60's seeing a lounge singer Sandie(Anya Taylor Joy) and she soon sees strange characters and a dark past. Many of these sightings and dreams lead to ghostly encounters. What is this picture trying to say is it to reveal a murder mystery or is it saying reincarnation or did Eloise live a past life. Only the film twist and reveals something about the past, murders, and trio of characters of Eloise, Sandie, and the old woman the renting landlady of Eloise's. May not be the best work still it's entertains and blends well with 60's times of fashion, and music as this is a mix of drama, horror, and suspense.",positive
3.5 out of 5 stars.Pros: Edgar Wrights stylish direction is entertaining. Its a psychological horror film that is about a girl moving to Soho. When visiting a rental room. She has visions of the 60s in Sandys perspective (Ana Taylor Joy).The film has a great soundtrack that works great with the film.It does have a few thrills that will keep you on the edge.Thomasin Mckenzie and Ana Taylor Joy did a great job with there characters.Cons: the plot becomes forgettable once everything comes together. Like any other ordinary supernatural thriller. A girl with a gift that can see visions of the dead and what happened in the past. Which someone was murdered. And she is trying to solve that mystery.The climax becomes dull once the twist is revealed which was not surprising or shocking. Which thw third act becomes weak compared to the rest of the film.,positive
"As ""Last Night in Soho"" (2021 release from the UK; 118 min.) opens, we are introduced to Eloise (a/k/a Ellie). Ellie learns she's been accepted at the London College of Fashion, and off she goes to London. She ends up renting a room on the top floor of an old house owned by an old lady. With stars in her eyes, Ellie falls asleep and when she wakes up, she's in Swingin' London with the new James Bond, Thunderball, playing in theaters... Is she dreaming? Or has she been transported back in time? To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest from British director Edgar Wright, who just earlier this year brought us the fantastic ""Sparks Brothers"" documentary, but he is better known for films like ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Baby Driver"". Here he dives back into London of the mid-60s, a/k/a Swingin' London. Was it all that good? Or do we have a selective memory? Around that Wright builds a plot-heavy story with a horror undercurrent, and that's all I will say about it. The first hour of the movie is fabulous. The second hour not nearly as much. Still it is quite enjoyable, with several strong lead performances, none more so than Thomasin McKenzie (as Ellie), but look out as well for Anya Taylor-Joy as Sandie, and Diana Rigg (in her last film role, and the movie is dedicated to her) as the old landlady. But perhaps the biggest fun comes from the many, many song placements that are peppered throughout the film, starting with Peter & Gordon's ""A World Without Love"" in the film's opening sequence, James Ray's ""I've Got My Mind Set On You"" (alter a hit for George Harrison), and all the way through the very end, when the title song comes from Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich in the movie's last scene, followed by Steven Price's ""Neon"" playing over the end credits. Just fantastic all around and I will be sure to check out the movie's soundtrack.""Last Night in Soho"" was filmed in the first half of 2019, yes 2 1/2 years ago, and was scheduled for release in 2020. Then a little thing called COVID-10 had other ideas (and almost killed the movie theatre business). The film FINALLY opened in theaters this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday early evening showing where I saw this at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati was not attended well (exactly 2 people including myself). If you are in the mood for a stylish horror-drama that oozes with fabulous song placements and has several strong lead performances, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater (while you still can), or eventually on VOD or DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",positive
"I saw ""Last Night in Soho"", starring Thomasin McKenzie-Old, Jojo Rabbit; Anya Taylor_Joy-The New Mutants, Split; Matt Smith-The Crown_tv, Doctor Who_tv; Terence Stamp-The Adjustment Bureau, the Superman movies and Diana Rigg-Game of Thrones_tv, On Her Majesty's Secret Service.This is a thriller with a gimmick and a good plot twist that is written & directed by Edgar Wright-Baby Driver, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead. The gimmick is a girl has dreams about the 1960's and can travel there in her dreams. Thomasin plays the aspiring fashion designer that has the visions/dreams. When she comes to London to pursue her career, she has dreams of Anya, an aspiring singer in the 1960's London Soho area. Matt plays the man that gives Anya a job in a club, but soon things turn dark for Anya. When Thomasin sees what is going on, she tries to help Anya-they inhabit the same body when Thomasin goes into the dream/past-and things get complicated when Thomasin meets Terence, whom she thinks is Matt in the present. Diana plays the landlady where Thomasin is staying in London. There is a lot of 60's music, a nice plot twist and Diana Rigg's last role-the film is dedicated to Diana.It's rated ""R"" for bloody violence, language, drug use and sexual situations-a little nudity-has a running time of 1 hour & 56 minutes.I would probably buy this one on DVD.",positive
"6/10 - I respect what Edgar Wright and his team were trying to do with this, but I could not help but feel that this story would have been far better served if it were less focused on traditional horror elements and more of a straightforward mystery with flashbacks.",negative
"Last Night in Soho follows Eloise, an introverted fashion design student who rents a room in an old building in Soho, London. Soon after, she finds herself having vivid dreams in which she experiences (and witnesses) the life of an aspiring singer, Sandie, who resided in the same room some fifty years prior. However, these dreams soon take a dark turn.This genre offering from Edgar Wright is a love letter to numerous horror films of the sixties, bearing shades of ""Repulsion"" and ""Persona"" alongside Italian gialli and outright supernatural horror. On a merely visual level, the film is a mind-bending odyssey through two women's lives in two starkly different time periods, drenched in neon lights. The cinematography is stunning, and there are numerous impressive optical effects (many of which appear practically done) in which Eloise appears as Sandie's mirrored double, witnessing/experiencing moments from her life as an observer who melts into the background. These are wonderfully orchestrated and a pure joy to watch.The performances here are uniformly strong, with Thomasin McKenzie leading as the quiet, nostalgic Eloise, and Anya Taylor-Joy playing the tragic swinging sixties counterpart. British veterans Terence Stamp and the late Diana Rigg have integral supporting roles here and are both effective in their parts. The only real complaint I have about the film is that, despite successfully blending its original ideas with classic genre elements, it does seem to sag a bit in the middle section, as the increasingly disturbing visions take on a hyper-supernatural nature that wears thin. Despite a few hokey sequences in the latter half, the film redeems itself with two unexpected plot twists that are legitimate surprises.Overall, ""Last Night in Soho"" is an audacious psychological horror effort that, despite some repetitiousness in its midsection, still stands up as a stylish film that sticks to the terms of its vision for better or for worse. When you think it's run out of tricks, it manages to throw enough curveballs in the finale to redeem itself. As far as over-the-top, garish horror goes, ""Last Night in Soho"" is one of the better contemporary efforts with a director and cast who remain fully committed to the material. 7/10.",positive
"LIKES:The Style: Like the poster and trailers, this film was hinted at being a stylish take on the horror genre, and it delivers this in so many ways. Wright leads a wonderful charge into two different time periods of London and make them look so dang fun and stylish to live in. There is energy from two different periods cascading into one story, pulling you into the story of this little play, working you into the life of our main character Ellie. Setting wise, it's an engaging piece that is realistic, dynamic, and engaging to the tale, with almost every place used well int eh story.The Presentation: The premise as you can see in the trailer is that Ellie is drawn into the past to see and experience the life of Sandy. While this may not be the most unique story we've seen, Wright's style is super intriguing in the transitions, especially in the beginning with how she wound up in the world. The fun aspects of life we see involve some fun use of mirrors and switching perspectives to really get you into the feel, only to then drop us back into the real world moments later. Sandy's impact on Ellie is then later explored and seeing the effects were super fun, and even more so how the later aspects of Sandy's life really start to spring on Ellie. These moments are placed well, and each scene has a life of its own, but yet is integrated into the whole picture to never fell too tangential or overwhelming form how smooth the piece was. I was very surprised by these transitions, and how well used they were given the potential to overdo the gimmick.The Acting: It's good, a fantastic display of quality acting in the genre where many just kind of bring their B and C game in most movies. Soho's group is strong across multiple fronts, and given the direction, character development, and chemistry was able to bring both worlds to life for me. Thomasin McKenzie is a wonderful lead, innocent and naïve, but holding much beneath the meek mannered persona she starts out with. As the movie continues on, she is pulled into other elements that require drastically going through the spectrum of emotions and bringing the terror out in this role. Anya Taylor-Joy is not quite as vocal or dynamic as McKenzie's role, but dang does she play the past role extraordinarily well in what she was told to do. I can't reveal much, but let's just say that she has a combination of confidence, sex appeal, and artistic presentation to bring the emotions of the 60s era to life. She bounces well in the scenes shared with McKenzie, and the looks she gives speak volumes over the dialogue that other characters were given in this film. Matt Smith has the looks of his counterparts super well, executing the cocky arrogance of the times to an artful degree, and adding the dramatic flair that ties things well together. His looks in the suits, alongside the nonverbal acting, speak volumes and establish the atmosphere he holds, and I can't deny that he elevated a lot of scenes in the beginning to drive the pace and story.The Pace: A movie like this can be slow given all they try to do, but Soho did not feel long to me at all. Because of the ever changing nature of the film, the smoother transitions, and continued evolution of the mystery continued to move to the end. With little tangential detours and not trying to force messages and politics in my face, Soho managed to keep us on the story and lives of the character helping to move the film to its conclusion with steady steps.The Characters: So nice to find a horror movie where the characters are much deeper than the usual fodder we get. Like the acting, the characters have a lot of layers and quirks to deal with, never being perfect or overpowered, but rather strong and persistent to overcoming their problems. McKenzie's journey was relevant to me on several elements, and I loved the approaches she took to figure out a lot of the happenings in the two ""worlds."" This is true for so many of the characters, many of which are used well to progress the story and actually not just be there to be an overdramatized statement. This is definitely true with the character John, who has a lot of great moments in the film without stealing the show the show away from the group. It was great planning and attention to detail that this genre needed very much for me, and I was happy that Soho delivered this.The Music: Those who like the classics and appreciate the use of music should really enjoy the styles of this film and how much the music moves the scene. What is used for a character development in one scene, suddenly gets turned into a jaunty number of fun and 60s dazzle before dropping into a simple montage piece to express the emotions of Ellie. Other sequences have the setting amplified to wonderful levels, sometimes being creepier than the visual elements presented. And do not worry, Soho has a combination of modern vibes and big band fun to get you into the moment and I had a blast with it.The Story/Genre: Again, the story is not the most unique or artistic thing I've seen, but what surprises me is how many genres were crammed into this movie. Soho is not simply a horror/thriller as the categories painted, but instead manages to add layers of other components into film to mix things up and help it stand out from most other films in these categories. There are elements of a comedy that work in just seeing Ellie experience life in London, but then drama comes in to help complicate matters and add a realistic portrayal that is not buried in cheesy scares. The drama further elevates in a different manner at parts of the movie, and soon a mystery starts to develop that soon starts to fold into something else. Crime and Thriller elements start to resonate even further, and soon the horror creeps in only for the other elements to peak back in and allow the other genres to rest. You would think it would be convoluted, but instead it's balanced and meshes well to make a twist on life that again is fun to watch and again interesting to solve all the deceptions hiding in the two worlds.DISLIKES:Character Utilization: While there are many characters used right, there are others that held more potential and sadly were cut from the final number. The past selves of a couple of the older characters held some potential to add to the mystery, but I can understand the reasons for their limited use. It's the mean girls that plague Emmie's life and I would have loved to see them integrated a little more in the push to get Emmie to continue diving into the world of the 60s London. It's a small complaint, and there are others I'd have liked to foster relationships with, but the stronger relationships work well for me.The Seedier Moments: You can guess that Soho's neon lights are going to offer many a thrilling dazzle, and some of those moments are going to be portrayed to big details. While I don't suffer from this type of PTSD, I caution those who are sensitive to take heed at the detailed moments of abuse that will be present in this movie. I'm not big on these moments, and fortunately they are lighter, but it only takes one memorable scene to scar your mind so caution.The Violent Moments: I can't say I really hated these moments, but a couple of the times that got intense crossed the border into savage territory. Again caution to the squeamish and the sensitive to noises because these moments are very loud and sort of hurt my ears as the chaos unfolded. Again, it's a minor dislike, but still one to watch for, alongside the flashing lights if prone to seizures/migraines from this aura.The Ending To A Degree: When things finally come together, the ending act starts to fall and unravel, with the horror element sort of fizzing out for the dramatic part. I did not hate the ending at all, but after all the buildup, I feel the climactic moment took a direction I was hoping it wouldn't and gotten the true finish worthy of putting everything to a close It's got some symbolic finale with it, a nice job towards the style and character development, but it sort of trips at the end to stumble across the line. And yes, there is some predictability to it, which does lay the foundation for figuring out what will happen in that final moment. And even more so, the special connection Ellie has is left rather unexplained and convenient, and I would have liked that shock factor to have been that connection.The Verdict: Soho was a stylish surprise for me, that tied back to the classic elements of the horror element and blends multiple genres to make an engaging story. With fun characters, intriguing premises, some realistic lifestyles, and two worlds to balance, Wright brings us a layered tale that should grab a lot of the attention for multiple audiences. Acting continues to shine and some of the characters allow our actors to spread their wings and take thing to deeper levels than the usual thriller/horror cast. A great moving piece with lots of visual and audio components to enjoy Soho has much to check out. True, the character utilization does require some work and tweaking, and there are some intense moments that could hit sensitive viewers, but the main weakness for me is the tripping of the final act to not deliver the full potential that was building up to it. Still, I had fun with this movie and encourage you to check it out if you get the chance in theaters.My scores are: Drama/Horror/Mystery: 8.5 Movie Overall: 7.5.",positive
"Last Night In SohoI liked it!On the whole this was a stylish and sophisticated thriller/horror set in the present day with recurring dream sequences taking us back to the ""flesh-pots"" of Soho in the 1960's.We had a stellar supporting cast led by Diana Rigg in her final role. The opening premise suggested Eloise had a fragile mentality following the early death of her mother, however it became clear as the movie progressed that she was, in reality, communing with ""dead people"" and the vibrations emanated from previous residents of her bedsit.The movie was not without its problems but these did not seriously effect my enjoyment, these were:The lead actress Thomasin McKenzie possessed the look but not the heft to take the lead. Her elfin looks and squeaky voice, delivering lines by a circuitous route, irritated and that combined with a choice of just two faces fell should of the requirements of the role.The script was more that clunky and ran out of ideas early on, this lead to dragged out repetitive sequences of running down streets in Soho merely to take in the sights and provide padding.The denouement, whilst refreshingly unexpected, was a fizzle rather than an effervesce.I'm giving this a 6 outta 10, meaning a good Halloween horror worth a watch.",positive
"Last Night in Soho really had me hypnotized. I feel like that's a comment that will be said by a lot of people, but that's exactly the kind of effect this film has. Edgar Wright brings us a dreamy, groovy ghost story that heavily pays tribute to Suspiria, along with other film classics from the 60s and 70s. Being Britain's top film junkie, Edgar Wright can get a hold of a camera and make it seem like you're walking into a video store at full blast. His love of this specific genre of horror is just gushing here. His love of music is also as romantic as ever. Music plays just as important of a role here as it did in Baby Driver, even if the songs aren't full-on characters of their own. Mackenzie and Taylor-Joy carry this film fully on their shoulders, and by God, do they rock it. I've been incredibly impressed with Thomasin Mackenzie since Jojo Rabbit, and if this film doesn't rocket her career all the way to the top, nothing will. There's so much to love about this movie. It's a trace. No, it's a trip.",positive
"Edward Wright was trying to make his own Six Sense version; considering he is the guy after the CORNETTO TRILOGY it is obvious something you want to see. Wright can do outstanding visual tricks mostly without FX and his imagination and rhythm are almost impossible to match. He has a great taste with music and sometimes the movie feels like a musical.Anna Taylor Joy is an incredible charismatic strong actress; like a young Elizabeth Taylor . Thomasin McKenzie is really good in a more easy role. However in the last acts; when she is invaded by madness, her action soars to outstanding levelsThe story takes its time to start with typical clichés like the rural girl trying to adapt to the big city of London (adding some complicated family madness); but Wright uses those common places to play with the public; showing a safe zone that is far from safe. The game is really well played and it shows at the final acts when nothing is really what it seems.Eloise is a shy, rural British young girl that sometimes see dead people (or is very sensitive; her mother committed suicide). She moves to London to study fashion design.; but after meeting a bunch of archetypical IT girls/ room mates; leaves the campus and moves to room rented by an old lady.In her room she starts dreaming about Sandy; very vividly and become enchanted with her personality, her guts and joy of life. After a while she realizes that Sandy's life was not a fairy tale and the happy dreams become nightmares. Eventually the ""chic flic drama"" becomes an unexpected horror movie.There is nothing wrong with all the above; however there is some cheating that might disappoint. Specially the final scene.In any case, this and almost perfect exercise in cinema. With scenes staged in ways not seen in a long long time, outstanding 60s music and very intelligent switch by the end.",positive
"Time to join the Anya Taylor-Joy and Thomasin McKenzie simp club.And it's the last movie of October for me. I was excited for this movie not only because of the trailer, but also because of Edgar Wright, who directed Baby Driver and Shaun of the Dead, two great movies. In fact, Soho was my second most hyped movie for this month, just behind Dune. So it's natural that I had big expectation for this movie.First of all, this movie looked great. Edgar Wright portrayed Soho with such an elusive mix of neon red and other colors that not only make the city looked beautiful but also disorienting and dangerous. The transitions between the present and the past were smooth. As from the trailer, we knew that McKenzie's and Joy's characters were in the same person. The I loved the nice switch between the two characters as well as how they looked through the mirror.The story was also pretty good. Although it wasn't as twisty and unpredictable as I expected, I still liked the descent into madness and blur between reality and dream. The runtime didn't feel too long and as the plot became more intense, I was more drawn into the story.Perhaps the best part of the movie was the two lead actresses. The chess queen Anya Taylor-Joy was mesmerizing as the confident running-up performer. It was easy for her to stand out in the crowd. Thomasin McKenzie was just as amazing with her voice and performance as a young aspiring fashion design student. Both actresses looked incredible and magnetic with their blond hairs and cool costumes. It was hard to look away from the movie because they were on the screen most of the time.My main problem with the movie was that it wasn't scary. Sure, the amazing editing did make many scenes disorienting and intense, but I didn't find myself terrified as the movie intended to.Overall, it was still a damn good movie. Sadly this movie isn't performing well at the box office, which was a shame. Go support and enjoy this mystery thriller. 8.5/10.",positive
"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free thoughts, please follow my blog to read my full review :)""Last Night in Soho is incredibly captivating throughout the entire runtime, but Edgar Wright's all-in in the insane third act is definitely going to generate a divisive response.Story-wise, the compelling protagonists - brilliantly interpreted by Thomasin McKenzie and Anya Taylor-Joy - follow intriguing arcs holding unexpected revelations that ultimately make sense with the overall narrative. Stunning cinematography and production design come together to create a visually jaw-dropping 1960s London, which becomes an even more entertaining place to visit due to Steve Price's addictive music.However, the last act feels a sudden hurry to tie every knot through overwhelming editing, hasty pacing, and careless transitions, which work against what the film had been until that point.I commend Wright's commitment and extreme dedication to his vision, but the restraint shown previously should have also been part of the conclusion.""Rating: B+",positive
"IN A NUTSHELL:In acclaimed director Edgar Wright's psychological thriller, Eloise, an aspiring fashion designer, is mysteriously able to enter the 1960s where she encounters a dazzling wannabe singer, Sandie. But the glamour is not all it appears to be and the dreams of the past start to crack and splinter into something far darker. This film won the ""Most Anticipated Film for 2021"" from the Hollywood Critics Association and was nominated for Best Film at the Venice Film Festival.I absolutely adore both of the leading ladies, Thomas McKenzie and Anya Taylor-Joy, so I had to see this. What a powerhouse of talent these two beautiful women possess.THINGS I LIKED: I've been a huge fan of Thomasin McKenzie ever since I first saw her doe-like performance in the movie LEAVE NO TRACE and JO JO RABBIT. There is something very special about her. She has a unique innocence that is so fresh and charming. Some are already saying she could easily play a future Disney princess. Agreed! Next to the polished and incredibly talented Anya Taylor-Joy, they both keep you mesmerized to the screen. They both showed great physicality and we also get to hear Anya Taylor-Joy sing in this film! Anya Taylor-Joy is fantastic in every movie she does. I absolutely enjoyed their performances in this film.I love stylish transitions and there are plenty of them in this film.The fantastic Last Night In Soho (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) blends the stylish 60s with horror. It includes music from Cilla Black, Petula Clark, the Kinks, and other appearances by 1960s legends like Sandie Shaw whose song actually won first place in the 1967 Eurovision competition! The music really takes you back in time and oozes style.Speaking of music, director Edgar Wright has always done a great job incorporating music into his movies in creative ways. I was blown away with how he used music in his movie Baby Driver. I thought that movie was brilliant.I love twists.The use of mirrors in many scenes is clever and well done.Some of the characters go to a Halloween party, so the release of the movie this weekend during Halloween is perfect.If you've seen Italian Giallo horror movies, you'll recognize this film as an homage to that filmmaking style.The subtle and overt aggressions toward women are illustrated very well. Most women will be able to relate, which makes female audiences even more receptive to the actresses' stories in the movie.The production design is really great.The makeup and costume design is also very good. It was clever to darken Thomasin McKenzie's makeup as she fell deeper into her psychological journey.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE: The movie feels like it was made by two different directors. The tone of the film is dramatically different from the first half to the second half.The ending is problematic and even frustrating.Sadly, this was British actress Dame Diana Rigg's last film before she died from lung cancer last year. She had a very long career in stage and screen, winning many awards for her performances. In 1988, she was made a CBE in England and named a British Dame in 1994 for services to drama. Those not familiar with her earlier work might recognize her for her role in Game of Thrones: Seasons 3 & 4TIPS FOR PARENTS: Some profanity, F-bombs, and crude language Pre-marital relations You see two girls in bras Lots of alcohol and smoking People are murdered in bloody, gory ways Prostitution Scary-looking ghostsYou can see my full review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel.",positive
"It's pretty obvious director Edgar Wright had a really cool gimmick in his head loaded with music and decided to run with that. If you are a fan of 60's tunes, this will be a treat. Take most of that away and it is an extended ""Tales From The Crypt"" Not a bad way to go. BUT, something is just missing. A sense of the why makes one frustrated. Why is Eloise (Thomasin Mackenzie) getting these visions? Why would she be so deserving to share the past?The production itself is one to behold, centered on Sandi or Alex or Andi or whomever you want her to be. Played seductively by Anya Taylor-Joy, whose otherworldly beauty was perfect for this role. A sex kitten whose innocent eyes make men weak. But there is a more sinister way about her ambition. Parallel this with Eloise's entrance into the big city, and you can predict the outcome.This film leaves more questions than answers. One is just inundated with such nostalgia for great music and style it feels crushed by its own detail. Mackenzie, for her part is frustrating. You want to shake the hysterics from her. But somehow gains the sympathy of...more people than she deserves. I'm baffled by the message this entire film asks. If there is a question anywhere. Which leads me to wonder...why?Poor concept aside Anya Taylor Joy is just so watchable. Everytime she's on screen she radiates feminity. And that is worth the price. Aside from that, it follows the same melancholia which a movie like ""Bad Times At The El Royale"" oozes. They share the same DNA when it comes to the haunted 60's. I didn't believe once Eloise was enveloped by the 60's. A movie like ""Somewhere In Time"" nails the obsession perfectly. Here, it's all show which makes her seem more like a hipster than a true fan.The high rating alone is to see Anya's sultry Sandi.",positive
"A ghost story with a great 60's atmosphere throughout filled with great music that really brings the film together. The story covers well-trodden ground, with a small girl trying to make it big in the big city and a portrayal of the seedier side of showbiz as well as the glitz and glamour. The twists are good, although the ending sequence does go on for a bit too long. The acting was good, but some characters felt unnecessary and overall, it could have been a lot darker and more shocking.",positive
"I enjoyed the film for the artistry that went into making it, and the performances were excellent by the leads, but ultimately, the story didn't make much sense. Why was she seeing what she was seeing - did she have some special power like being able to see dead people? And why was she sometimes incorporated into the character she was seeing and other times a bystander? Don't want to go beyond that because it would involve 'spoilers', so you'll just have to see it for yourself. I'm neutral on recommending it.But be warned, my wife is not a fan of 'horror' movies, and she suggested this one thinking it was a suspense/thriller, then ended up plugging her ears and closing her eyes for much of it. So it might not be quite what you are expecting.",negative
"Last Night in Soho is so many films. Technically, it's perfect. Incredible angles, using of the camera, mirror sequences and absolutely great soundtrack. I also like the main story in the past and the connections with the present story. Great acting overall, especially Anya.When it starts to be a horror film, it loses itself a bit and that is the most disappointing part of the film, as I was expecting much more as a horror film. However, contrary to some, I really liked the plot twist (don't come with the political bs that the ending made the good look bad and bla bla bla, life is like that) and I think that elevates the film to be more than just technically good.",positive
"A dazzlingly vivid portrayal of London, an emotionally captivating and thought-provoking pscyhodrama, a visually magnificent production and yet another home run for director Edgar Wright, Last Night In Soho is an absolutely mesmerising watch, and easily one of the best films of 2021.I loved every minute of Last Night In Soho, a film that evolves and changes a lot over its 116-minute runtime, but always has a trick up its sleeve as it takes bold and thrilling turns at every step.There's so much that makes this film such a dazzling watch, but we'll start with the brilliant lead performances from Thomasin McKenzie and Anya Taylor-Joy, whose fantastic energy makes this movie an enthralling watch from the first minute they arrive on screen.While Edgar Wright impressively directs a whole ensemble cast here, McKenzie and Taylor-Joy are the real standouts, each delivering genuine yet exciting and mysterious performances that bounce off and parallel one another brilliantly throughout.That plays into the film's captivating psychological element, as we see young Thomasin McKenzie in modern-day London become obsessed with Taylor-Joy, an aspiring singer whose dreams take a dark turn when she finds herself caught up in the underbelly of Soho in the swingin' sixties.Not only does Last Night In Soho brilliantly balance its focus on modern-day London and that of yesteryear, but it uses parallels in geography, style and essence to great effect, bringing that into the central character story at hand and pulling you ever deeper into what starts out as a dazzling whirlwind, but becomes something rather a lot more challenging.The first act of this film is exciting, vibrant and wonderfully imaginative, capturing the wide-eyed innocence of a country girl arriving in the big city for the first time. But beneath the superficial thrill of a lively London lies a dark reality, which Last Night In Soho handles in a uniquely lively way, but also with riveting, thought-provoking dramatic depth.While never ignoring the gritty, sobering and desperately depressing reality of the industry that underpinned Soho in the '60s, director Edgar Wright brilliantly keeps the energy and pizzazz that makes this movie so electrifying even through its darkest moments.That makes for an exhilarating blend of disturbing drama, eye-catching style and even some darkly funny moments that build and build and build as we see the psychological state of our main characters deteriorate.While Last Night In Soho may be all The Look Of Love on the surface, it's rather more similar to Roman Polanski's Repulsion, using its setting to brilliant effect as it turns from a dark love letter to London into a maddening psychological thriller that never lets up until the last minute.Bathed in spectacular colours, featuring gorgeous cinematography and a memorable soundtrack, Edgar Wright leaves no stone unturned when delivering yet another feast for the senses after the rocking rollercoaster that was Baby Driver.But with a bold combination of dark, sobering drama and high-octane, lively and dazzling thrills, Last Night In Soho offers up an entirely unique viewing experience, that's simultaneously huge fun to watch while being immensely insightful and thought-provoking in its subject matter.",positive
"Last Night in Soho is a new psychological thriller directed in part written and produced by Edgar Wright, the director of Shaun of the Dead and Babydriver.The film follows the young Eloise (Thomasin McKenzie) who moves to London to study fashion design. She expects to break through in the fashion world with this education, but the education and her life in London are more difficult than she expected. In her dreams, Eloise keeps seeing entertainer Sandie (Anya Taylor-Joy), whom she uses as inspiration for her fashion designs. She quickly becomes a successful student. In addition to fashion ideas, Eloise also learns about Sandie's life in the 1960s during her dreams. Eloise's dreams start to become the pinnacle of her days, but as the dreams begin to get darker, they become more and more like nightmares.Edgar Wright again conveys this new film well in his own way. He does this by mixing different genres in an appropriate way. Furthermore, he also has the audacity to bring out certain things in the film in a way without going too far. This is particularly evident in the film world that is trying to do things more safely and by the book these days, so as not to hurt the hypersensitive. The film also contains good twists, which you as a viewer try to get through before the film reveals it, but because of the writing of the screenplay, the film often manages to stay one step ahead and things are revealed at the right time. Unfortunately, the story lacks some small details that could have put the finishing touches on it if it had been worked out just a little better.Together with his editor Paul Machliss, Edgar Wright knows how to juxtapose the scenes where the main character goes from the real world to her dream world. These scenes are flawless to the secondtransferred. In these scenes they switch flawlessly from Thomasin McKenzie to Anya Taylor-Joy and back again.The switching of film sets makes the switching of these two different worlds seem credible. This is due to the switching of details on the film sets, clothing and music. They also know how to convey the different film genres well.Thomasin McKenzie comes across well as the lead of the film, as someone who tries to do as much as possible in the old-fashioned way in the modern world. Because of what her character experiences in the dreams, she often has to portray the role in other ways. Anya Taylor-Joy also has to play her character in a different way when the dreams get darker. What they do this in an appropriate way law. Terence Stamp also plays a mysterious older man, of whom you as a viewer don't know whether he can be trusted or not. Matt Smith also plays the same kind of role in the film. This film was the last role she played in a movie for Diana Rigg, because she unfortunately passed away last year. Despite having a small role in this film, she managed to end her acting career in a fitting way with this film.Many additional characters in the film unfortunately play weaker background roles in the film and can make the film come across as a bit less. If some of these extras had been left out of the movie, the movie would have been a little better.",negative
This is a different film with a novel plot and it worked well. I didn't see the twist coming and I thought it was well played out.There were a few things that I thought let the film down but overall it was a very good watch.,positive
"ANTLERS (2021) *** 1/2 KERI RUSSELL, JESSE PLEMONS, JEREMY T. THOMAS, GRAHAM GREENE, SCOTT HAZE, RORY COCHRANE, AMY MADIGAN, SAWYER JONES. Effectively creepy horror film centering on a young boy (a truly amazing Thomas) whose family's encounter with a wendigo in the Pacific Nothwest results in a paralyzing grip of fear and intimidation that eventually catches the attention of his new (and equally traumatized) teacher (Russell giving some unexpected gravitas) with some truly harrowing results. Excellent direction by Scott Cooper (who collaborated on the to-the-bone scary screenplay by Henry Chaisson and Nick Antosca - based on his short story 'The Quiet Boy'), eerie atmospheric score by Javier Navarrete and beautifully shot cinematography by Florian Hoffmeister dovetail into a compelling supernatural chiller with some also impressive visual f/x and make-up concoctions. Executive produced by Guillermo del Toro. One of the year's best horror films (and best films period).",positive
"Greetings again from the darkness. I'm sure Scott Cooper is a well-adjusted, happy guy. At least I hope so. However, if he were to be judged only by his movies, we would assume the man is humorless and focused on serious topics only. He's also extremely talented as a filmmaker, as evidenced by CRAZY HEART (2009), OUT OF THE FURNACE (2013), BLACK MASS (2015), and HOSTILES (2017). This latest is his first monster movie, and again - no happy thoughts, despite the expert craftsmanship. Mr. Cooper co-wrote the script with Henry Chiasson, and Nick Antosca's, adapting Antosca's short story, ""The Quiet Boy"".There is a lot to take in with this one: Native American legend, child abuse, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, economic woes, strained family relationships, and yes, a violent monster. Keri Russell (""The Americans"") stars as Julia Meadows, who has returned to her hometown to teach school. She left 20 years ago due to an abusive father, and still carries the guilt of leaving her younger brother in that situation. Trying to mend their relationship, she has moved in with him. Paul (Jesse Plemons, I'M THINKING OF ENDING THINGS, 2020) is the reluctant town Sheriff who doesn't say much, but carries out his thankless responsibilities in a dutiful manner.We witness Frank Weaver (Scott Haze, OLD HENRY, 2021) in his meth lab hidden deep in a coal mine, while his youngest son Aiden (Sawyer Jones) waits in the truck outside. In a terrific scene, filmed brilliantly, Frank discovers what else is hiding in the mine, and it changes things forever. Julia teaches Frank's older son Lucas (Jeremy T Thomas), and immediately hones in on him as a kid with all the signs of being abused. And it turns out, Lucas does get bullied by a Scut Farkus lookalike played by Cody Davis, and Lucas' art work leaves little doubt things aren't going well in his life.What we soon learn is that Lucas is carrying a burden that no one should have to. Julia's history plays a role in pushing a school administrator (Amy Madigan) to investigate his home life. Filmmaker Cooper has created a perfectly oppressive atmosphere, and there are some terrific elements - including the performances of Keri Russell and young Jeremy T Thomas. However, at times, it feels like the story strains to include all the messages it's trying to deliver. Proof of that comes in the form of Graham Greene (WIND RIVER, 2017) and his role as the former sheriff. His appearance is too brief and he seems to have drawn the short straw as the character having to spell things out for the audience - the Native American legend of Wendigo, and how the spirit has been awoken by man's destruction of nature.Florian Hoffmeister's cinematography is top notch and captures small town life in rural Oregon, as well as the monster moments. Composer Javier Navarrete is to be commended. His score never overwhelms, as happens so frequently in horror films. The film is produced by horror master Guillermo Del Toro, and his fingerprints are evident. The loose mythology and heavy-handed lessons for mankind are salvaged by the terrific practical effects and gloomy atmosphere. Director Cooper has delivered again, though this may not be his natural genre.Opens in theaters October 29, 2021.",negative
"I didn't expect this to be so disturbing, morbid, and so well filmed especially cinematography but it really is! Scott Cooper created a visionary folk story that is quite effective, I'm shocked of the 6.2 rating at least it's above average. Keri Russell is so nurturing/perfect for this I wouldn't want anyone else. I really like how there's a few jump scares and grotesque violence that's very rare; I hope that's not considered a spoiler I try not to. Antlers is amazing for what it is!",positive
"I'm getting a little sick of films that I have been looking forward to for a very long time, due to pandemic delays, finally arriving and being a let down. Unfortunately 'Antlers' has to be another one to add to that list. The film wasn't at all what I was hoping for.I can't remember the last time I checked my watch this many times during a film. I kept wondering when the action was going to start. The film is only 99 minutes long, however about 80 of those are purely build up. And then the pay-off isn't much to write home about anyway. I'm all for patient horror, but you have to make it worth it for us.A few good things need to be noted, for example the film looked very good. The CGI (the little of it we actually get to see at least) really was impressive. Also there is one jump-scare late in the film that I'm not ashamed to say got me very good. Also having Jesse Plemons in your film can never be a bad thing.I guess I just felt this one didn't have anything unique to offer. You've seen one monster movie, then you've definitely seen everything this one has to offer. If you were considering choosing this as your 2021 Halloween film I would suggest perhaps looking elsewhere. 5/10.",negative
"I saw ""Antlers"", starring Keri Russell-Star Wars:Episode 9_The Rise of Skywalker, We Were Soldiers; Jesse Plemons-Jungle Cruise, Paul; Jeremy T. Thomas-Paradise Lost_tv, Lore_tv and Graham Greene-Longmire_tv, the Twilight movies.Wendigos finally get their chance to shine in a horror movie. Who knows? Maybe even a franchise. It's based on a short story called The Quiet Boy by Nick Antosca and because of the pandemic, it has been delayed a few years-the end credits copyright said 2019. Keri plays a teacher in Oregon that has noticed signs of abuse on one of her students, Jeremy. Keri tells the principal at her school about her suspicions and when the principal goes to Jeremy's house to check things out, she doesn't come back. It seems there are more unexplained disappearances in the area-as well as partial bodies being found-but luckily, Keri's brother Jesse, is the sheriff. When some bodies are found, they are usually dismembered, as if by some kind of animal-or maybe a Wendigo? Graham plays a native American that tells Keri & Jesse about the Wendigo urban legends, consisting of cannibalistic creatures that have been inhabiting the region and the hunt is on.It's rated ""R"" for violence, gruesome images and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 39 minutes.I really liked it and would buy it on DVD.",positive
"LIKES:The Filter: It's dark, it's grey, and it's perfect for the established setting that Antlers takes place in. Oregon's rainy plateau and heavy forested areas hold much in the way of horror, but the added grey filter gives you the feeling of isolation in this small town. The creepy elements of the movie are amplified to an extent that you can feel the malice of the monsters and its victims in just about every shot. It's that set up that is definitely the heavy lifting of the movie and like E. T. did in the 80s, immerses you into things at the just the right amounts.The Artistic Approach to Horror: Unlike many horror movies, Antlers took a less direct approach to horror and focused a lot more on the storytelling and build up instead of the jump scares. It works on a lot of levels, especially on the subject matter of myth, legends, and storytelling, primarily on how it effects a culture and grows into an entity of its own. That concept is very much like the beast in this film and they do a great job of circling the obvious source of the carnage before you ever get the real vision of what is doing this. Your Imaginate gets to sort of paint the idea of what this nightmare will look like, and that kind of storytelling is sometimes even better if done and timed right.The Realism of the Entity: Let's face it, horror movies are seldom the most logical or realistic concepts given the themes they are often going for. Where we have ghosts with double standards, killers capable of transporting at the drop of a hat, and psychics who suddenly become gods, the absurdity of the movie monster has gone sky high in an attempt to be unique. Fortunately, Antlers grounds the nightmare to a reasonable level, creating a legend that actually has merit in being believable without ascending supervillain level. As the movie progresses, the actions of the antagonist grow to mirror that of the established legend and keep to moments that really do feel like it's after you in the woods. Sure, it's not the most cunning, exciting, or even most intense thing to grace your presence, but it works for the rules established and goes with the theme. Again, it's the new atmosphere of the movie that works for me and seeing the other actors build up the horror, is the true level of creep factor that the movie does well.The Characters: Antlers again moves towards realism with the characters it portrays and how they have developed from their traumatic experiences. These aren't individuals who have developed super powers or alternative identities, nor are they these cannon fodder sacrifices who are gussied up to the be the pretty face that we see get devoured. No, these characters are certainly realistic portraits of what people with rough past can be like in trying to cope back into real life. It leads to more engaging characters and potentially rooting for them finding a means to break through what lies in the woods. This drama element is very strong in the movie and the horror of how to handle all this pressure from the situation is really well done and truly a beast itself.The Acting: The movie's staple is the acting, which is hands down incredible for a movie of this genre that normally does not rely on acting to make it better. Keri Russell is sensational in the lead, a balance of terror, depression, and trauma blending together into a lead that has both heart and brains to search for the answers. She does not tread into the overacting territory that much, keeping to the established responsibilities of her character and transitioning into the role quite well. I felt she really integrated herself in the character of Julia and engaging with all the characters in a natural manner. Jesse Plemons is a good character to bounce off of Russell's more energetic nature, his blandness sort of establishing a character who compensates for his past in a more toned down way. A great glue to the town setting, Jesse's range of acting is not as taxed as Russell's, but does accomplish what he needs for advancing the plot and ""mystery"" element of the film. The winner for me is Thomas though, a young actor with a fantastic range and maturity in his performance as Lucas. A role that could have been much more limited, Thomas had a lot of adult elements to face in this movie as he tried to salvage his life situation to the best of his ability and portray someone drowning in drama and stress. I can't say more without giving away plot elements, but his way of going through the stages of these breakdowns is super impressive for me. He somehow channels the wisdom of those decades older than him, but never lose the innocence of the child he is.DISLIKES: The Predictability If you've seen the trailers or read the synopsis, you'll be able to predict about 90% of the movie before it concludes. This diluted the horror element for me alongside the surprise twists this movie would have done well to have, but overall it's not the worst limitation for me in this film.The Lighting: While certainly a wonderful element for establishing the mood and enhancing the creepy atmosphere, there are times the darkness can get in the way of the full scene and giving you the full picture of what lies out there in the woods. Antlers could use some lighting adjustments and slight tweaks to the mix, only going pitch black at a few times before enhancing the lighting to give more details. If watching at home, I recommend minimizing glare where you can, because it can really block the scene if you have too many lights on.The Carnage: This is not a movie for the faint of heart or stomach, as it does not pull the punches for showing the deaths and chaos of Antlers antagonist. Like the Walking Dead on steroids, this movie's realistic approach means you will see some torture and tearing that might be too disturbing. An applause to the special effects and make up that I did not mention earlier, as they really do make props and accessories to bring the death to life. However, there is so much depressing mauling I can take at times before it grows a little too much for me.The Character Development/Backstories You can tell that this movie may have had more planned for diving into the psyche of our characters as they circle around the issue plaguing the town. An opening scene hints at the pasts of her demons, establishing the character's struggles and what she had to do to survive. Other dialogue points to similar arcs for character like Joel, Lucas, and other characters that could have been engaging and useful tools for advancing the plot. Sadly, all those elements are practically absent, lost to brief shots and moments that sort of feel out of place without fully fleshing out the sequences and giving us those answers that still lay in mystery. Realism for deflecting gets some points, but what was the point of bringing it up if they did not have intentions to pursue it? This is the weakest element for me to be honest of the movie, and for one focusing on legend and taxing of your character, those origin and struggles internally need to be ironed out to deliver the character delivery you are looking for. This incomplete story telling really stands out in a lot of moments and takes away from the movie as a whole for me given the approaches they were taking.More time with the monster: It's a unique approach seeing the thing's progression to the screen, but it's not until the last 15 minutes that you get the full picture of the antagonist. Again, I would have debuted the thing a little earlier and provided a more thrilling engagement than what I felt we got at the end. Though a bit tough, I think there was more that could have been done to finish the film, but the short run time and potential cuts means a director's cut might be out there to fill in the gaps in the future.The VERDICT: Antlers is one of those movies that feels like a hybrid of an Indy horror and a Blockbuster for me. It's got great visual style, establishing a setting that will strand you out into the small town of Oregon and the community who is scared of the unknown events. The focus of story driven scares, character centered sequences, and using your imagination to paint the antagonist work very well and help establish a realistic horror that can be appreciated in the sea of cheesy movies that this genre sometimes gets. And the acting is by far the strongest point for me with talent from the younger star really blowing my mind at how well he could bring so much to this character. However, by taking this approach, Antlers scare factor is a bit diluted from the traditional sense and has a lot of elements that get in the way of a masterpiece scare flick they were going for. Pacing and predictability sort of dilute things, and the carnage may be more disgusting than creepy given the response of a few patrons in my showing. The two biggest limitations of the film though are the limited backstories/character development and little time with the antagonist that will be the most disheartening to many I think. It seems like this movie was incomplete to me and so I can't say that I'm surprised that with the delays, things suffered in the final cut. Overall, this movie is probably best watched at home with a theater like room, and I would give the film:Drama/Horror/Mystery: 6.5 Movie Overall: 5.5.",positive
"Have heard about this film a couple of times but somehow was never released & partly due to the Covid-19 Pandemic, but out of nowhere it appears & I went to see it & have.The film follows a boy who is feeding his dad who is slowly turning into the Wendigo. His teacher, who is a recovering alcoholic & in an unhappy marriage starts to notice the boys weird antics, but it is then that she uncovers the dark revelation that nobody saw coming...!I found the film to be pretty dull mostly. For the first 20-30 minutes the film doesn't half drag & drag with each scene being nothing but talky talky droning dialogue with no punch of charisma. Literally, I was yawning to tears it was that bad & even when it DID get going was the pay off not worth it. The gore & action were good, but the film was flat, dull & boring mostly, it reminded me of Babadook, it was a slow droning depressing film with no punch or impact.The story was pretty naff too & the characters were pretty flat & forgettable, much like the film itself. The film simply lacked a strong & direct narrative, not to mention a punch of impact to keep the audience interested. You simply couldn't care about the film itself never mind the characters, the motives, what was going on etc, the film felt careless & pointless.Overall, at 94 minutes, the film is pretty dull, boring, slow moving & flat all round, not to mention boring. Don't watch, & if you do prepared to be bored stiff.3/10.",negative
"Oh Deer Lord.I have been hyped for this movie since watching the trailer last year. It looked great and the premise about a boy living with a monster definitely intrigued me.And I was mostly disappointed. I was satisfied with the look of the monster, which was where a big chunk of the budget went to. The R rating was justified with many gory scenes where not only adults but also kids got devoured. It's not as brutal as like Malignant, but still entertaining enough.The first disappointing part was the story. It had to follow a rudimentary formula with nothing unpredictable. There was of course a guy, played by Graham Greene, who existed in the movie only to give some exposition to the mythology that I don't even care much about.The second disappointment was the ending. It seemed way too easy and lackluster for the main character. It was like they didn't know what to do next with the story, so they wrapped the ending up and called it a day.The third, which was not as problematic as the first two, was the scares. Sadly the movie had to rely on jump scares, and the sound was so obnoxiously loud. However, this was not a big problem because the scenes where the creatures were shown looked great.Overall, I wanted a lot more from this. 5.5/10.",negative
"It's hard to believe Antlers was produced by the great Guillermo Del Toro, Antlers was a bit of a mess.Let's start with the pros.The originality: This film is extremely original and the story was very unique.The cinematography: This movie has amazing cinematography, with its beautiful use of wide shots and clever use of colors, the color scheme feels like rural Oregon.The talent: The young boy gave an exceptional performance as Lucas, and the teacher was mostly fine.The creature: The creature was very scary, and the film had a good use of jump scares.Dislikes: The entire film feels like a set-up, it had the basic horror movie tropes such as don't go in that room and they do, it takes almost the whole movie for the story to start, and when it does it barely pays off, also how did the sheriff survive getting thrown against the wall and stabbed like that with very little blood? The story never built to really anything of merit, and the ending was extremely predictable.There's also a conversation in a hospital that felt very out of place and tacked on, many choices felt rushed.In the ending it kind of felt like a cash-grab, and I'm gonna give it a C-.",negative
"Antlers is a new horror film directed and written in part by Hostiles and Black Mass director Scott Cooper.Set in a remote Oregon town, the film follows teacher Julia Meadows (Keri Russell). She has a traumatized history behind her. She suspects her student Lucas Weaver (Jeremy T. Thomas) is going through a similar situation. Together with her brother Paul (Jesse Plemons), the local sheriff, she tries to help Lucas, but in order to do this they must unravel his dark secrets. With this film, Scott Cooper tries to capitalize on an interesting horror concept that has not yet been successfully presented in another horror film. In other films, this concept has remained more in the background or conveyed poorly and implausibly. With a Steven Spielberg style, he tries to bring this horror concept to the fore with a slow build-up without immediately clearly portraying it. This can divide the viewers into two different groups. Some remain interested in the slow build-up to the end result, while others may drop out due to the tedious time and lose interest in the film. It's a shame for both that he seems to have frayed the final ending of the horror concept, leaving all viewers a bit disappointed. If they had brought out the details a little better, the movie could have been a little clearer and more entertaining. Throughout the film he manages to maintain a good and appropriate atmosphere of a dramatic dark side. This succeeds by conveying the film largely dark, foggy, and rainy. The effects in the film are for the most part good and believable by not showing certain things directly or by keeping them in the shadows. This way you as a viewer just get to know what the characters are dealing with. In scenes that play more in the light, it can be seen that they also used CGI to transfer creatures. They try to mix the mechanical and digital effects, but the clarity of the digital effects overshadows the film. Sometimes credibility is lost. By using bloody makeup set pieces, they try not to lose the viewer's interest.The acting is well done by the lead actors in the film. Keri Russell comes across well when trying to help someone with a dark past and others with a similar life. Jeremy T. Thomas also comes across well for a novice film actor as a young person who tries to keep his dark secret well hidden and trusts few people. Jesse Plemons also comes across as a helping agent and knows how to provide light comedy. Unfortunately, they and especially many of the characters do commit the horror clichés by, for example, only investigating things, without waiting for reinforcements or passing on what they are going to do.",negative
"Standing tall with a running time of one hour and thirty-nine minutes, by the time the credits roll and this movie comes to its end, you'd be forgiven if you mistakenly thought that only 80 minutes had passed. You see, ""Antlers"" seems to be suffering from an identity crisis, unsure of what type of movie it wants to be - because of that, so much content is crammed into the relatively short length that ""Antlers"" feels more like an amateur short than it does a professional feature.""Antlers"" moves fast, too fast for its own good. Almost immediately you'll find yourself introduced to a flurry of different plot threads - many unique and interesting themes are touched on in this film - children covering for the crimes of their parents; the cycle of abuse, and how far reaching its negative effects are; and of course, the idea of a mythological creature that feels an unquenchable, insatiable hunger for human flesh. There's a lot going on, and unfortunately, nothing gets enough time to fully develop. A lot of the most interesting concepts that the movie has in store are skipped over and dropped as fast as they were introduced. The movie seems to be aiming for a sort of break-neck pace, but it does no favors when a more slow and steady tone would've given all of the plot elements the time they needed to breathe.You'll for sure find yourself having whiplash by the rapid shifts in tone, ideas, and story, but at the least you'll have some nice scenery to look at. There's no denying that ""Antlers"" looks good - the dreary atmosphere works wonders in making viewers feel unsettled. Additionally, the creature itself looked terrifying; there is a shot at the end so chilling that my jaw literally dropped. In terms of sound, the monster also sounded appropriately horrific and scary, letting off shrieks and screams that genuinely disturbed me to listen to.How were the performances? Honestly, pretty bad, at no fault of the actors. The script in this film is lacking - the dialogue feels so unnatural that believability is nonexistent. Characters don't feel like they're having conversations; they feel like they're reading from a script. Characters will say things randomly, and out of nowhere, without proper context to clue the viewer in as to what exactly they're talking about. As such, prepare to find yourself dazed and confused at the utter lack of logic at play whenever anyone opens their mouth.The visuals alone, both in terms of cinematography and of how the creature looks, do make this an okay one-time viewing. Other than that, though, there's not much else to enjoy here, and nothing for me to recommend. With a rushed plot, poor performances, and a bad script, ""Antlers"" is one of the more forgettable horror films to be recently released.",negative
"It's enjoyable but it has a typical horror story that is similar to many other stories we've seen before. It has some good creepy and disturbing scenes, it also has some cheesy ones. All in all, it has nothing new or original to deliver but it's watchable.",negative
"Yet another film that was delayed about five times since its original release date of April 2020. I can now see why they opted to truly wait till it could have a wide release. This is a film that while definitely has familiarity as far as the overall themes and scares, but can definitely stand on its own as another great creature story. The fact that it's directed by Scott Cooper is also pretty interesting to me and he definitely puts his signature brand of bleakness in his overall Visual delivery which works especially well with a film like this that needs those types of dark and grim environments. The acting is pretty solid all around and Keri Russell carries the intensity well. The main aspect that I highly praise is the fact that we can see the creature just the right amount much like films like a quiet place and it's sequel, where we don't have to beg and plead just to get a look at the creature. There are some films that try to be creature features and never even show the creature at all so it's nice that in this renaissance that we're having we're actually getting these types of films that Harken back to 80s/90s. Overall a very well executed film and I can definitely see why Del Toro wanted to have his production hands into it.",positive
"This movie was quite surprising to be fair, I was expecting a typical horror with the basic format of scare here and there with a cliche ending, but no this creature feature is actually quite unique with very interesting themes about trauma and abuse and has great parallels between the two main characters. The effects were pretty good and the creature looked really good when it's finally revealed. The acting was solid even the kid actors weren't bad at all. The score was pretty cool and fit the creepy vibe of the film. Not too long and not too short of a film, perfect length for these sorts of films as they drag on if they're too long and feel bogged down with exposition. Not much to say really about this one. Just a solid horror, go see it!",positive
"First, I So Wish They Would Stop Sorting by 'Prolific Reviewer' and go back to sorting by 'Helpfulness' as 'Prolific Reviewer' is always some studio pigeon or some weird guy who watches too many movies.Second, love Scott Cooper's 'Crazy Heart' which won Jeff Bridges a Oscar nomination.Have no idea how the director went from 'Crazy Heart' to this horror film from that same guy who loves these strange creature films. Never understand them.My Rating: 6/10.",negative
"This was a good core story but very, very drawn out. It reminded me of an episode of Masters of Horror, which at an hour felt long with this similar concept. Good try but you may find yourself checking your phone a few times.",negative
"I have been waiting patiently to see this movie. The trailers really were fantastic. All in all, I enjoyed this movie. It has great atmosphere and that is something that is absent from most movies today. It's not a perfect movie but what it offers is a unique story that isn't found often today. I really enjoyed the native lore in this movie and I think that it is a subject that has a lot left to give. The child actor does a fantastic job as well. Give this one a shot.",positive
The only horror in this movie is the horror it was made. It was so depressing and sad. I felt no empathy for the characters whose back stories were non existent. There was no explanation to the existence of the monster. It was just there. Give it a miss.,negative
"So, the first line Anna Bogutskaya said when talking about this film on the Mayo and Kermode show was ""This wants to be a Guillermo Del Toro film but lacks the heart"". This is such an accurate statement, I could just leave it at that and get on with my morning...but I have more to say so I shall continue.So, it needs to be pointed out that whilst this is a Guillermo Del Toro PRODUCED film, it is directed by Scott Cooper, responsible for movies such as Crazy Heart and Out Of The Furnace. This is where one of the biggest issues in the film's tone and execution fit in. Guillermo Del Toro does fantastical, big, wild large scale productions that even in infancy had an element of fantasy, and an idea of characters overcoming severe emotional or situational trauma and ending up better for it. Scott Cooper, by contrast, is best described as a gritty realist filmmaker whose films are well shot but ultimately incredibly depressing whilst at the same time not following through enough with the depressing themes to say something with this. This disconnect results in a theme of abused characters trying to conquer their abuse...but ultimately losing everything in the process...and not overcoming it...and also kind of conquering it in a way that doesn't quite add up with what we've seen so far.By far the most scary and effective material is done with the child Lucas in this movie. The kid who plays him, Jeremy T. Thomas, is excellent - and is certainly a better child actor than the kid who played his bully in the film, who was terrible. His role in the film is that his dad and brother are infected by a mysterious illness that makes him cannibalistic, and he works on keeping them safe. On the other side, you also have Keri Russell and Jesse Plemons as sister and brother Julia and Paul, both of which dealt with abuse in their past that makes them feel attached to Lucas' case. Their acting is solid, although it is very fair to say that Russell has way more to work with given her character's abused history gets explored whereas Paul feels quite short changed on front. But back to Lucas, his stuff is easily the best part of the film, as it follows him searching for roadkill and killing other small animals to give the family he feels obligated to a life, and it's oddly haunting in the way the film should've been.However, now I have to begin my problems with this film that stops it being as good as it should. The film, whilst being very well shot, very well scored, is incredibly, unbelievably predictable. To an annoying level. So the creature in this film is a Wendigo - and I'm being completely honest here, I knew the creature was a Wendigo before I even walked into the cinema without reading a synopsis, spoilers, review or anything because Wendigo's are in everything these days. But that's only the start to where the film's problems are when it comes to this: the film has serious issues when it comes to plot armour and reverse plot armour. For example, in the climax, the Wendigo transformed from Lucas's dad absolutely annihilates a cop called Dan, who in the whole film had about five lines so I knew he was destined to die, much like Lucas's bully who was portrayed as a one-dimensional dickhead who was there to get horrifically killed. Right after this, the Wendigo attacks Paul, and unlike Dan who gets instantly killed, we have a prolonged sequence that seems very illogical, and doesn't even end with Paul dying. And then when Julia faces off with this creature that just completely overpowered two trained Policemen with sheer ease in less than desirable circumstances, a female schoolteacher is able to hold her own in perfect conditions for this creature. It was ridiculous, and it takes away from the realism that Scott Cooper wants to enforce in this movie but is, ironically, consistent with Del Toro's themes. There's also another character who lemmings herself into death that allows the plot to kick in, when it may have been more effective for them to do the smarter thing but it fails anyway. All of this leads to a bizarre sequel baited ending that I'm genuinely unsure why it's there, or how it happened in the first place. Once again, leaving it more final and maybe focusing on the psychological impact of all this unresolved pain would've been more effective.That's not to say the movie is ineffective in scaring audiences. It has a very ominous presence throughout the entire story, and is well shot with a spaced out and tense theme throughout. Not to mention, whilst limited, the Wendigo is well shot through and is an imposing, frightening presence - the transformation scene is particularly horrific in an amazing way, and the creature has an initially unsettling trait in the appearance with it having Lucas's dad's skin over its face like a Hannibal Lecter style thing. It's just a thing that could've been amazing if given a bit of extra tightening.",negative
"Antlers is a dread-filled, thematically rich, emotionally hefty horror film that has a lot on its mind and on its surface.The film is visually gorgeous. The lighting always serves to only show you exactly what you need to see and nothing more, leaving a lot to the imagination. The creature effects appear largely practical, and CGI is only used when necessary.The characters are all developed ambiguously and slowly, leaving room for speculation about them while also making them people to feel for and root for.The story boasts dark themes of childhood trauma and abuse and how such things poison all who are involved in them. Visual metaphors abound but they are all subtle enough to warrant multiple interpretations.My only minor complaint is that I could've used a couple of extra scenes to develop the brothers' relationship. The ending would have been more impactful had such scenes been present.This is not a film for everyone-but it is a film for those who like horror that keeps them thinking.",positive
"I loved the bitterness infused in this story. It's hard to improve on the far bleaker short story by Nick Antosca, but succeeds in providing more social context, fleshing out the characters, giving them more reasons to make certain choices.The casting and performances are terrific, as is the cinematography and setting.My only critique is on of personal taste which concerns the music, which for me, popped me out of the artistic statement of the film, being too conventional and sounding like a ""horror score"" when something more atonal and abstract could have helped.Altogether it still contains the bleak, quiet majesty promised. I recommend the film highly.",positive
I watched Antlers at an early screening expecting to see a decent horror film. Turns out Antlers in neither decent nor horror. The movie is not scary at all. The only thing that might be placing it into the horror genre are the gruesome imagery that it includes but other than that it would be fair to call it more like a fantasy mystery film that's a little more spookier than expected. But even if you are not looking for a horror film Antlers is still bad. The dialogues are cringy and full of cliches. I was bored towards the middle because the progress of the movie is pretty slow and with very little progress happening in every act. Even the third act isn't really rewarding. Wouldn't recommend it especially when your options include Halloween Kills.,negative
"Saw Eternals yesterday and although it's not Marvel's best I did like it. Marvel wants to expand its MCU and the only way to do that is to introduce new characters. Well, Eternals has a lot of them.I loved the premise of the film.It's basically about this bunch of superheroes who came to earth thousands of years ago to protect mankind from a threat. They disappear once they have succeeded but have to reunite in modern times when the threat returns. Too bad they're in for an unpleasant surprise...So far the story.With every new film with new characters and events it must become harder and harder for Marvel to fit everything into the MCU. In the film they mention The Avengers once or twice, but ""strangely"" Thor and friends don't interfere when earth is in trouble again. No, the Eternals have to clean up their own mess.The lovely premise also works against the movie though.There is much to be told and even 150 minutes doesn't seem enough. There are a lot of flashbacks and exciting locations but those also make the storytelling rather messy. Strangely I liked the build up (first part) more than the finale. As a non-comic fan I was surprised at the twist at the end. I guess all the comic fans already knew that would happen? The flying scenes with Ikarus were incredible.Overall I think Eternals is too long but still entertaining. It's not a real punishment to have to look at Gemma Chan (Humans, Crazy Rich Asians) and for the ladies there is always Richard Madden (Bodyguard, Game of Thrones) who hopefully will be the next 007. Oh, and of course Kit Harrington also has a small role (that will be expanded in future movies?). It's Kumail Nanjiani (The Big Sick, Silicon Valley) however who steals the show. He makes sure the story lightens up from time to time. Angelina Jolie has a surprisingly small role. Although she does a good job, a lot of attention goes to the fact that it's this superstar playing this small part. Perhaps it would have been better if they had chosen a less known actress.I do think that storywise - with an ensemble movie like this - it would have been better to have focused more on one character. That should have been Gemma Chan, who is also presented as the main lead in the movie. It should have been her story.I presume that in Eternals the new ""Thanos"" is introduced, so for Marvel fans it's not a movie to be missed. The two after-credits scenes didn't tell me much. The first one opens ""a new direction"" (but does seem important after I looked it up) and the second one has something I cannot place but will no doubt be explained by other fans when the movie is released.Oh, and although I'm Asian myself I also thought that Gilgamesh was the same character as Wong in Doctor Strange and Shang-Chi. But the first one is played by Ma Dong-seok (Train to Busan) and the other one by Benedict Wong. So they're two different characters 😊A daring but flawed new Marvel film.7,5 / 10.",positive
"MIDSOMMAR is the latest film from arthouse director Ari Aster, whose HEREDITARY wowed audiences a few years ago. While I liked that film I didn't love it, but I do love folk horror and THE WICKER MAN so I expected a lot from this one. Sadly, I didn't get it. MIDSOMMAR is a real mixed bag of a movie, with a decent first half. Florence Pugh gives a fine performance and the opening sequence is particularly powerful, getting off to a good footing. The slow-burning suspense works effectively until the genuine shocks of the 'cliff' sequence, but after this things really stop working. There's the usual sex and violent content, but it all feels very meandering and dragged out, saddled with unlikeable characters and a genuine lack of meaning and narrative cohesion. The cinematography is great and the actors certainly do their best, but by the end I felt this had become predictable, random (Viking execution methods for shock value, etc.) and a bit like a boring slasher film.",negative
"Dani Ardor (Florence Pugh) is suffering after her troubled sister killed their parents and then herself. She jumps at the chance to join her anthropology student boyfriend Christian Hughes and his friends who are following Pelle to a Swedish commune.Ari Aster has made two feature length films so far, this and Hereditary. No one pushes the envelope that far, right out of the gate. He is a filmmaker worthy of the attention. As for this film, his skills are not to be questioned. This is an unsettling story. When that member says matter a factly ""It's a Bear"", that's the moment I'm looking for the exit. Dani may be looking for something and the students may be more obsessed with their paper. The whole situation is spooky. The expert filmmaking may be covering up the emotional devastation of Dani. That's the first priority of the movie. Instead of flashy camera moves, it would be better to tell the beginning much more naturalistically. Her depression is the film's journey and it needs to set off as straight as possible. She could also be more specific in her journey. Again, this has to be her movie. I do like her journey. I don't care as much about Christian. There is a lot of WTF moments. Some of it is too WTF like Aster is deliberately pushing buttons. His expert filmmaking can come off like that. I want the pain, not a visual representation of pain.",negative
"After about five very prolific years of making short films, writer and director Ari Aster made his first full feature film not too long ago and ""Hereditary"" was a huge success. Now here we have his second full feature movie and while the first had major supernatural horror elements, this one here does not. Or well, it does in the minds of many characters and their deeds to serve their highers, but this is of course just theoretical. It is a horror film, however, there is no denying. Even when we are not yet in Sweden, the circumstances of the female protagonist's sister's death are as dubious as it gets and there is also a shockingly graphic image of that. But the vast majority of the film is set in Sweden, so it should be no surprise to anybody that this is a Swedish co-production and that there are many Swedish cast members, especially with this title. It's probably most effective to watch this film on a really hot summer day outside, but I only got half of that last night when I watched it as my second post-Corona movie at a(n outdoor) cinema. The weather was not so nice the way it was a few days earlier. But it's alright. By the way, this is a really, really long film at almost 2.5 hours and the one big name attached to this project is Florence Pugh. Well, the biggest name I should say. 2019 was an amazing year for her scoring her first Oscar nomination for ""Little Women"" and actually I am a bit surprised to see her in this film here. I would have imagined Alicia Vikander or so. Anyway, I think she does a fine job and she is also pretty stunning fur sure. I am growing into a bit of a fan I think. Also really liked her on ""Little Women"" and she was maybe the best thing there.But back to this film: The only other cast member I am familiar with here is Will Poulter and he is always easy to identify. I remember him very well from Bigelow's ""Detroit"" and he was amazing there, so I hope his career will rise in the coming years. His character here feels almost a bit too small given the actor's talent. He is mostly in it for comedic reasons. Be it his comments when everybody is stoned, how he regrets having missed some of the action, how he is delighted to be led away by the Swedish girl (while he has no clue what's waiting for him) or of course how he pees against that ancient tree trunk. His normal simple man character you could say went very much against conventions, especially in that secret society there. He was a riot at times. I must say nonetheless that I had no clue what eventually happened to him. It was him smacking down the Black dude when the latter went for the bible right? Was he also under some special drug? He was alive still in any case. Well, somewhat alive. These drugs are a big thing in this movie and the joints the group is smoking early on are definitely as harmless as it gets with what else is waiting for them later on. Just take a look at the protagonist's boyfriend near the end and the drink he is offered and reluctantly drinks and then this sex orgy starts. Now that was maybe the most bizarre moment of the entire movie. Not the act per se as you could see that coming with how the ginger girl is mentioned several times (although I did not think that it could be her pube there), but all the other women in this specific scene and how they interact with the girl (the weird singing next to her head) and also how the old lady slaps the dude's butt. What the heck? And of course, how ginger girl says right away she can feel the baby. So yeah, like I said it's all the awkward, bizarre and weird elements from this movie that turn it into something slightly fascinating. Not always fascinating as you can see from my rating.Another example would be the comment about how all the tribe's (let's call them that) oracles are the result of inbreeding. Very messed up. This specific scene shows nonetheless that while they try to seem harmless to others, it is all part of a plan. At the exact same time, we have a member of the tribe tell the American characters that there is no coordinated big-scale inbreeding. So things are clearly not even close to what they seem here. It reminded me a bit of ""Get Out"" in terms of the overall scenario. And the characters here sure needed to get out as well. Also how two characters have the intention to write their thesis on this tribe and the elders reluctantly agree under certain conditions, but they only did so to keep the guys there because they knew they will probably never get out to release their thesis or tell anybody about this tribe. As for Christian (played by Jack Reynor), Pugh's character's boyfriend, I always somehow felt he could also be in on the entire project that there is something evil going on, especially how he reacted to the double suicide ritual (man, some nasty shots there from Aster, definitely nothing for young audiences), but looking at what happened to him at the end, he probably wasn't in at all.The only one really in on everything was the Swedish buddy who led them there and his talking to Pugh's character especially already implied that maybe he appreciated her more than he should have. It's alright though. I still wonder why. I mean he could not know that she would become the new May Queen. Probably he was just very keen on having outsiders there, so the tribe can do with them whatever they want. Okay, what else can I say about this movie. It is horrifying at times, funny during other sequences, very dark humor, but maybe the area where it delivers the most is the visual side. The costumes (especially the queen's massive flower dress we see at the end, she basically becomes a flower herself) are as spectacular as the cinematography and you could feel the burning light and heat very well through the screen here, almost like a knife cutting through and blinding you if we go with metaphors. This was very well done. And of course the make-up and sets as well. Nothing wrong there at all. So the only aspect where it did come a bit short (just a bit, not too much) is the script. I think they could have cut 30-45 minutes here and it still would have been a decent film for sure, even if it definitely did not drag too much. But there are scenes and sequences that feel like filler material.As I am approaching the end of my review, I also want to talk about the end of the movie, especially the scene when Pugh's character is really having her meltdown and the others there are screaming with her, basically following their new queen. Joining in with her. I also felt somehow that maybe she could get sacrificed, but she did not. She will have to wait till she gets 72 for that I suppose. Long way to go. That cut-throat gesture when the Swedish buddy was asked was also pretty good, pretty creepy too. And with Pugh in the end, her smile somewhat implied that her sanity was gone now too completely, even if the fact that she agreed that her boyfriend should be killed still felt more like an act of mercy than an act of cruelty or insanity with what they had done to him. This killing scene also explains the bear we see early on and that one was also very random and, as a consequence, very comedic. So yeah, I think I am in the minority here, but I liked this film more than ""Hereditary"", so this shows you that I am not as much of a fan when it comes to the latter as everybody else. I am still curious what Aster has coming up next. And in the future. The talent is undeniable. I hope he can continue this positive trend and make more good films. This one here is by no means perfect, but I give it a thumbs-up and positive recommendation. Never in doubt, but like I said: Don't watch it with kids or people who can't deal with graphic violence.",positive
"Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren) invites a group of college kids to go to his small commune in Sweden to witness the Midsummer festivals at a time when the sun doesn't really set. The film centers on Dani (Florence Pugh) whose bipolar sister killed herself and her parents.Things went pretty much as expected as we get the ""Wicker Man"" and ""Harvest Home"" combination. The movie is about average.Guide: F-word, sex, nudity.",negative
"Be first thing I wanted to do after leaving the cinema, was to discover what the swedish thought of this film, in general they saw it with humour, and an open mind, as I expected.It's pretty much split right down the middle, first half, dare I say it, normality, drama, with a heavy focus on grief, and the harsh way it can affect someone, particularly if there's trauma involved. The second half is very trippy, and we delve into the world of pagan ritual and bizarre rights, which makes The Whicker Man look like a tea party.The main leads, Florence Pugh and Jack Reynor, were terrific. Pugh had impressed previously in The Little Drummer Girl, it was obvious she was destined for big things, she played Dani with a real sense of torment, very impressive. The cast had a realism, it was refreshing not to watch a cast that look set for a Dior catwalk.It won't be for everyone, and I must point out that some scenes are painfully long, needlessly. Some amazing special effects.Violence and nudity, but neither are gratuitous or simply for shock. A few laughs, several times the cinema erupted in laughter.Very good. 8/10",positive
"This scary movie was becoming something of a talking point before I even saw a trailer, and when I did it looked like a Wicker Man style movie, I was definitely looking forward to it, written and directed by Ari Aster (Hereditary). Basically, college student Dani Ardor (Lady Macbeth's Florence Pugh) suffers from severe emotional trauma during winter, after her sister kills their parents and commits suicide, flooding the house with carbon monoxide from a car. This trauma adds further pressure to her relationship with her anthropology graduate student boyfriend Christian Hughes (Jack Reynor), who is already emotionally distant. The following summer, Dani attends a party with Christian and friends Mark (Will Poulter) and Josh (William Jackson Harper). Christian and his friends are invited to attend a midsummer celebration in Hälsingland, Sweden, by their Swedish friend Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren). It only occurs once every ninety years at Pelle's ancestral commune, the Hårga. Dani finds out about the trip, and Christian awkwardly invites her to join them. The group arrives at the commune and together they take a psilocybin concoction offered by Pelle's brother, Ingemar (Hampus Hallberg). They also meet English couple Simon (Archie Madekwe) and Connie (Ellora Torchia), they were invited to attend the festivities by Ingemar. The psilocybin causes Dani to have a bad trip and she hallucinates about her dead sister. The group are initially accepting of the commune's peaceful if strange nature, routines and rituals. But then tensions rise after Pelle brings them to witness an ättestupa ritual in which the two elderly commune members commit senicide by leaping from a clifftop. When the male elder fails to die as a result of the fall, several members crush his skull with a mallet. The group are disturbed after witnessing this ritual, but they decide to stay, at the behest of Pelle, and because Josh is writing a thesis about the Hårga. The next day, Simon and Connie disappear, but the group is assured they were taken to the train station. Christian decides to copy Josh's thesis on the Hårga, causing a rift between them. Josh wants more information from an elder on the commune's ancient runic practices, which are based on paintings made by Ruben (Levente Puczko-Smith), a deformed member selectively born incestuously, he is considered an oracle. Mark unwittingly urinates on an ancestral tree where ashes are scattered, he is scolded by Ulf (Henrik Norlen), and later lured away by a female member, never to be seen again. That night, Josh sneaks into a temple to photograph scriptures in a mysterious book, he is distracted by a partially nude man wearing Mark's skinned face, he is hit over the head with a hammer and dragged away. The next day Dani is invited to partake a maypole dancing competition, all taking part must continue dancing until they fall and are eliminated. At the same time, Christian is drugged and groomed to participate in a ritual in which he impregnates virginal commune member Maja (Isabelle Grill) whilst being watched and surrounded by naked female elders. Dani wins the competition and is crowned the ""May Queen"". Following her victory, she discovers Christian having sex with Maja, she has a panic attack, several of the Hårga women surround her and wail with her. A disoriented Christian realises what is going on, he runs out naked and hides in a shed, there he discovers Josh's leg, and Simon who has been ritually dismembered as a blood eagle. Christian is found by an elder and then paralyzed with an unknown drug. The cult explains that, at the conclusion of the ritual, nine human sacrifices must be offered. The first four victims are outsiders, therefore Josh, Mark, Connie, and Simon. The next four victims are cult members, two senicide elders, a still-living Ingemar, and a second living volunteer. As the May Queen, Dani must choose the ninth and final victim, either an outsider or a lottery-selected cult member. Bitter and heartbroken, Dani chooses to sacrifice Christian. He is stuffed into a disembowelled brown bear and placed in a yellow temple alongside the other sacrifices. The temple is filled with straw bales and set alight; the cult celebrates the completion of their ritual. Dani at first sobs in horror but gradually begins to smile. Also starring Anna Åström as Karin, Gunnel Fred as Siv, Julia Ragnarsson as Inga, Liv Mjönes as Ulla, Gabi Fon as Dani's Mother, and Zsolt Bojári as Dani's Father. Pugh gives a good performance as the emotionally damaged young woman, Reynor is reasonable as her unworthy boyfriend, and Poulter and other supporting cast members do well also. It is very simple, people brought to a secluded location to be carefree, with a pagan cult behaving strangely and slowly becoming more suspicious and sinister, the twist here is that it is in a location where the sun never sets, you can see obvious similarities to The Wicker Man, it is perhaps a little too long, and as a ""slow burner"" it is maybe too slow at times, but the continuing strangeness, occasional shocks and violence, and tension keeps going, a reasonable folk horror. Worth watching!",positive
"Dani his having relationship problems with her boyfriend Christian who has failed to mention that he is going to Sweden with friends for the summer to visit the home village of one of the friends. Following a family tragedy Dani invites herself on to the trip. When they arrive in Sweden they head to the remote community and find the locals preparing for a special Midsummer festival that only takes place once every ninety years. They aren't the only outsiders present; a young English couple had been invited by another villager. At first nothing feels too strange; then the visitors witness a shocking ceremony that leaves some of them wanting to leave. Those who stay gradually learn more about the community... however they don't learn just how the festival is to end until it is too late.This is a hard film to categorise; there are clearly horror tropes but for most of the run time little is happening. I didn't find it boring though. Rather than being scary I found it to be unsettling; the anticipation of something bad happening was more effective than when it did happen for the most part. There are some gruesome scenes but less than one might expect. While this may be a less disturbing film I couldn't help but be reminded of the 1970's classic 'The Wicker Man'; hardly surprising as the themes are so similar. The cast is impressive; especially Florence Pugh who is brilliant as Dani. Most of the film is set in a single location and that location looks really gorgeous as well as being somewhat ominous due to its apparent remoteness. Overall I'd say this won't be for everybody, I'm sure many will hate it, I however really enjoyed it and despite its length and slow pace was never bored... I'd certainly recommend checking it out.",positive
"Spurred on by his friends, anthropology student Christian (Jack Reynor) is on the verge of breaking up with his girlfriend Dani (Florence Pugh), but a family tragedy for Dani changes his mind. Feeling guilty about putting his girlfriend through further emotional trauma, Christian asks her to accompany him and his pals on a once-in-a-lifetime trip to the remote ancestral village of their Swedish friend Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren), who has invited them take part in the commune's nine-day midsummer festival.Director Ari Aster (Hereditary) might claim that Midsommar only pays homage to brilliant UK folk horror The Wicker Man, but all I can see is a blatant, bloated and extremely tedious rip-off. Where The Wicker Man (Director's Cut) runs at a reasonable 99 minutes, its engrossing story whisking the viewer along as Edward Woodward's character attempts to solve a mystery on a remote Scottish island, Aster's film (The Director's Cut) takes a whopping 171 minutes to tell its very familiar tale of unwary outsiders falling foul of an strange religion that practises bizarre rituals.Moving at a snail's pace, the first hour of Midsummar is a massive challenge for the viewer, as the students travel to the village of the Hårga, meet the locals, and take part in ancient rites which involve lots of chanting and taking of hallucinogens. Those who make it through this tedium will eventually be rewarded with a shocking scene that is the equivalent of Hereditary's decapitation (ie., it's designed to wake up the viewer and become a talking point): before the eyes of the horrified students, elders of the village throw themselves off a precipice, falling onto the rocks below with very messy results.Anyone hoping that this will herald a turning point in the film will be sorely disappointed: the dull drama continues, with an excess of singing, dancing and a glut of aerial overhead shots, with hints of weirdness to indicate where the film is heading (as if we didn't know already). As Christian's friends go missing one-by-one, and the locals become increasingly weird in their behaviour, neither he nor Dani question the wisdom of remaining in the village, both continuing to partake in the commune's activities. A bit of ritualistic sex and the sight of a bloke with his lungs pulled out of his back are about the film's only other noteworthy moments before the whole boring mess finishes in inevitable fashion, stealing its fiery climax from... you guessed it.... The Wicker Man.In short, what a load of (Swedish meat)balls! If you haven't already seen it, watch The Wicker Man first.",negative
"I watched this at home on BluRay from my public library, not my wife's type of movie.This was made by the same writer/director that brought us ""Hereditary"" a year earlier, I like this one much more. It is confusing much of the time but when it is all over you realize it is a fable of sorts for the lead character, Dani, to come to some resolution from the loss of her family and coming to terms with her dud of a boyfriend.Look up the entire lyrics of 'Hotel California' by The Eagles, with this movie in mind you can find many parallels.I already was a Florence Pugh fan from her roles in Lady MacBeth (2016) and Fighting With My Family (2019). Here she is Dani who tragically loses her sister and parents, in grief accompanies her boyfriend and three other guys to Sweden in late June to witness, and ultimately participate in, a ritualistic Pagan festival. But it also goes deeper, to the core of the group's beliefs. By the end Dani achieves resolution, the other four are not so fortunate.This is a really strange movie once they get to Sweden, there is very explicit and gory violence, there is a big non-erotic sex scene with a number of nude characters. Everything is designed to shock the senses of the viewer. I would not like to see movies like this on a regular basis but as a one-off experience I found it a totally worthwhile 2 1/2 hours.",positive
"All summer long, I've had people breathlessly tell me, ""You need to see this movie.""I've been down this road before. It was called Hereditary, Ari Aster's last film.I debated never watching this film, but then I reasoned that as much as I detested It Follows, I loved Under the Silver Lake.Maybe Aster would hit paydirt in this one. After all, I love folk horror films like The Wicker Man and Blood On Satan's Claw. How bad could it be?Woah boy.Dani Ardor is dealing with a lot. Her sister has killed her parents and then herself. This has also pushed her already failing relationship with her boyfriend Christian. Somehow, they stay together the whole way to summer, when she learns that his Swedish friend Pelle is going home to his commune family for a once in every ninety years ritual and is taking Christian and his friends Mark and Josh.Christian had no intention of telling her about the trip. In fact, his friends want them to break up. But then she's there in Halsingland along with them as they trip out and settle in. Hours later, two of the elders leap off a rock to their deaths, but when the male doesn't die, the others smash his head with a rock.The elder Siv explains that this is how life goes here in Harga, with every member dying in the same way at the age of 72. This would also be the point where anyone sane would get out.Two other guests, Simon and Connie, try to leave but miscommunication separates them. And to top things off, Christian decides to steal Josh's thesis on the Harga. That's when we learn that the commune' runic religion is based on an oracle who is conceived every few years via incest.Oh, where do we go from here? Mark pees on a tree and gets skinned alive. Josh tries to take photos and gets hit with a mallet. Dani takes more drugs and dances around a maypole whole her boyfriend eats pubic hair before impregnating another girl while the rest of the females all watch and push his butt in deeper. Yes, it may have taken Quentin Tarantino a few films before we all realized he has a foot fetish, but Ari Aster took all of one film and a bit of this one to show us that his go-to horror is obese and aged nudity.After finding Christian and Maja having sex, Dani has started screaming and all of the women turn it into a song. I laughed the kind of mad guffaw that Max Cady only reserved for classics like Problem Child. Somehow, this film, much like the last one that Aster essayed, has descended from horror into comedy through no fault of its own.If I told you that the cult members all disembowel a bear and shove Christian into it - get it, his name is Christian and he's being sacrificed? - would you believe me? Well, you better, because that's exactly the kind of ridiculous ending this movie has. Can you believe that some people were upset by this and how intense it supposedly got? Then why was I holding my sides and struggling to breathe as I chuckled with the kind of volume that I had once only thought possible in my wildest dreams?This film is a joke, told with false significance and no small fury, all screaming and yelling and singing and wishing and praying and hoping that someone finds it significant and important and worthy of notice. In short, it is everything that is 2019 - a country that asks for prayers on social media one day and shoots one another in the face the next. A sad moron screaming, ""Notice me.""Somehow, thirty minutes of footage was cut from this movie before release. I have no idea how this is possible, as it felt so ponderous that I fear that it's being over is just a surprise ending and the truth is I will soon wake up and still have forty minutes left to watch. It's the kind of movie that The Lord of the Rings films would tell to wrap it up.There are no surprises. I mean, the opening mural literally tells you everything that will happen in the film. And another piece of art shows a woman falling in love with a man, placing flowers under his pillow and then hiding her pubic hair in his food. This is exactly what Maja does with Christian.There is all the subtlety of a sledgehammer in this film. Every single story beat is so hammered home - yes, that's a horrible pun but this movie in no way makes me want to try - that you become wistful for the simple days of Toni Collette flying around without her head.The funniest thing about this movie is that it sees the Nicholas Cage The Wicker Man as more of an inspiration than the original. That might be all you need to know about this utter turd in the punchbowl.",negative
"In case you are Swedish, or of Swedish descent, and you righteously worry that from now on everyone will avoid your company during summer, or just stares at you as if you were a disturbed pagan sect member, you can blame writer/director Ari Aster. Just saying...This film required for me to slightly step out of my comfort zone. I have a natural aversion for horror/cult movies with a running time longer than 1h45 minutes; - let alone a running time of two and a half hours! Still, I really wanted to see ""Midsommar"", based on the recommendations of friends and fellow movie fanatics, and because it's inspired by (and paying tribute to) one of the greatest stories of all times; ""The Wicker Man"".Undeniably, I expected more. More of everything. It's probably wrong of me to compare everything here with the unsurpassable genius of ""The Wicker Man"", but this film is far weaker in every possible compartment. My first and major complaint obviously comes back to the endless running time. ""Midsommer"" has awfully little subject matter to fill up such a long film. The director, together with all the fans, will naturally claim the long periods of showing scenic footage, folklore dance/chant rituals and the effects of hallucinating herbs are essential for the atmosphere of the film, but it's incredibly tedious to sit through. Especially because, let's be honest, everybody already knows what is coming. I honestly think you needn't have seen ""The Wicker Man"" in order to predict what'll happen.And yet, there are many praiseworthy and qualitative aspects about ""Midsommar"" as well. I'm personally fascinated by the Scandinavian cultures and nature, so I was immediately enthusiast about a film taking place during Midsummer Festivities, and thus - in sheer contrast to practically every other horror movie ever made - in broad daylight! You simply must also admire that Ari Aster didn't turn his film into an open-air version of ""Hostel"", meaning the teenage protagonists aren't blatantly ignorant, or heading towards Europe without knowing anything about the local culture. Aster also put quite a lot of effort into providing the lead characters with a background and a personality.Strictly horror-wise, the film is a mixed bag as well. ""Midsommar"" contains a few very graphical and shocking moments, but the killings that actually matter occur off-screen. Presumably for atmospheric reasons again, but it nonetheless makes my horror heart bleed. And, finally, a major disappointment compared to ""The Wicker Man"", I found the soundtrack. For a film that constantly features dancing and chanting, the music is unmemorable. ""The Wicker Man"" was practically half a musical, with legendary parts like ""The Siren Song"" and ""Around the Maypole"", and I at least expected something similar here.",negative

"Dani (Florence Pugh) and her boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor) join a few of his buddies on a trip to a small remote Swedish village for its midsummer festival. Dani needs a distraction from her parent's deaths. This little trip is surreal and a profound distraction. This movie is a different type of scary. And involves a different kind of fear.

"Some have Related the Psychedelic Experience to a Religious Epiphany.In His Follow-Up to the Mega-Hit ""Heredity"" (2018), Writer/Director Ari Aster has once Again gone to the ""Dark-Side"" of Family or Communal Allegory.The Look is Psychedelica with a Colorful Palette of Flowers Everywhere and Bright Costumes of Cult-Members Exhibiting some Very Dark Rituals and Bizarre Behavior.It's Florence Pugh that Centers the Film with a Personality Constantly on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown with Angst Oozing from every pour.Confused, Intimidated, and Largely Lost, even in a ""Normal"" Setting, Suffering from a Family Tragedy of the Suicide/Murder of Her Sister, Father, and Mother.So, the Poor ""Dani"" goes from Barely Coping to a Strange, to Say the Least, Environment of Completely Foreign Religious Rituals.With a Boy-Friend that is as Vacant and Vacuous as a Tree-Stump.What Goes On in ""Midsommar"" is the Stuff that Films Like ""The Wicker Man"" (1973) and others have Explored.But this Film-Maker makes Every Religious Minute of it Stretched to the Breaking Point that Onlookers like ""Dani"" and the Audience will have Trouble Keeping a Grip.The Movie is Disturbing, Unsettling, Disgusting, Beautiful, and gives us quite a Ride to the ""Other Side"" of the World both Figuratively and Culturally and it is one that Few will Find Routine.The Sunshine is Eternal On Screen and the Darkness Resides in the Mind and Spirit.A Gut-Wrenching, Glorious Take on the Horror Film and the Horrors of Indoctrinated Souls Bound by Tradition and Ethnocentric, Hubristic Capitulation.",positive
"Hey, honey - let's take a trip to a surreal drug-fuelled Swedish festival with cruel pagan tendencies? Yes, I know - it all sounds too bonkers; and yes, for the main, it is. I think you have to be in the zone if you are going to get anything from this otherwise it could fairly be described as nonsense. There are shades of ""The Wicker Man"" here, but this is nowhere near as well written or as scary. Florence Pugh and Jack Reynor try their best but this just doesn't really work.

"MIDSOMMAR (2019) * Florence Pugh, Jack Reynor, Vilhelm Blomgren, William Jackson Harper, Will Poulter. To Quote the late, great Roger Ebert : I Hated, Hated, Hated This Movie Ari Aster is the 21st century M. Night Shyamalan ; um - that is not a good thing. He's a one-trick pony. His sophomore film follow up to the jaw-dropping horror film HEREDITARY is a major disappointment, a blatant rip-off of THE WICKER MAN and ultimately an exercise in futility. A group of friends are invited by another from Sweden to attend a nine-day celebration of his small hometown that quickly downward spirals into the fact that it's (duh) a cult with hellish consequences. While Pugh is arguably the best thing about the major misfire the biggest conflict is having any empathy for four obnoxious twenty somethings (not one can you root for or relate to as to the (sur)reality of their nightmare unfolding. I'm done with Aster; mic drop.",negative
"After a distressing family tragedy, Dani joins her rather indifferent boyfriend and his 3 college friends to attend summer solstice celebrations at the remote Swedish commune where one of them was brought up.When I saw the trailer, I thought ""This reminds me of The Wicker Man."" And I was right. If you are familiar with the original Wicker Man, this movie will not surprise you in the slightest. But is it any good?Well, it is beautifully photographed and there is some excellent sound design. There is a sense of creeping uneasiness, and some general nastiness here and there - it is a horror film, after all. The direction is sometimes very good, and sometimes a bit too much like showing off. And Florence Pugh is jaw-droppingly good.There is nothng by way of made-you-jump moments - not a bad thing, in my view.But there are a number of plot points which are inadequately dealt with which, to me, means they shouldn't have been there to start with - crass college pal Mark, for instance, whose attitude towards Dani has no payoff whatsoever. And this is particularly relevant given that this rather slight tale runs for 140 minutes. This tale unfolds at a pace which is a bit too leisurely. Losing half an hour would have improved the pace, losing an hour would have moved it along whip-fast.An excellent, and VERY disturbing final shot, though.",positive
"Writer/director Ari Aster really has a thing for dysfunctional family dynamics. ""Hereditary"" basically gave us the family from hell, and ""Midsommar"" gives us more of the same. At the center of this horror movie is a couple whose relationship is limping along -- he pretty much won't break up with her because of some recent traumatic events involving a murder/suicide in her family and the guilt he would feel at leaving her. Not the makings of a great romance. It's no wonder then that both find themselves allured, though in different ways, to a psycho hippy community while traveling in Sweden. He's wanted sexually for some mumbo jumbo rituals while she enjoys being embraced by one big damn family, no matter how bonkers they may be.Aster is an effective filmmaker and knows how to put together images that will unsettle and linger in the viewer's mind for a while. But this movie is too long and too lugubriously paced to be as effective as it might otherwise be. Florence Pugh is really good in the film's first half, but by the end she's so zonked out and hysterical that her performance grows tiresome. It's not really her fault -- it's just that there's far too much movie for her to have to fill.People who like a hard ""R"" rating will get their money's worth, but much of what gives the film its ""R"" rating comes off as silly.Grade: B",negative
"What would you think a movie involving white clothes and head wreaths would be about? If you said creepy pagan rituals then you're right.Unfortunately, Midsommar was about what I thought it'd be about. Pagan rituals. Were the rituals more extreme than--let's say--Wicker Man? Yes. But extreme wasn't what I was looking for. I was looking for truly different. Truly scary. This movie wasn't scary it was just disturbing. There were ugly nude bodies, some gore, and overall disturbing ceremonies but it was still a pagan ritual movie.But it was also slow. Exasperatingly slow. Slower than a constipated sloth. There were too many silent mood-setting shots. I've been programmed to know that silent shots in scary movies are for build-up. It's upon the movie maker to deliver on that build up. I can't count how many slow-moving shots in this movie were building up to nothing. I get it. You can't have something ghastly happen every time or it will become mundane. But not at all?When these five friends went to Sweden for a getaway and decided to stop off in some remote village for their nine-day festival you knew something was gonna go down. But did it have to move so slowly and drag on forever? Did the scenes have to last so long? Between crying, moaning, singing, dancing, and panting they added so many nerve-wracking noises. Yeah, they made the movie more disturbing and also more annoying.I remained patient throughout the entire film only to NOT be rewarded for my patience. As I suffered through the main character's neurosis and moping I couldn't help but think, ""There better be gold at the end of this rainbow."" I hate to say it, there was no gold... nor silver, nor copper, or any precious metal. It was just a fire being fed with two and a half hours of my precious time.",negative
"Greetings again from the darkness. Summer movies are traditionally tentpoles and teen flicks ... big budget action movies and those aimed at an audience that are on a 3 month reprieve from school. We are quickly learning that rising star filmmaker Ari Aster cares little for tradition. Well at least he seems to thrive on twisting tradition and spinning off in an unusual direction. His feature film debut was last year's mega-hit HEREDITARY, a horror film which was noted in most every critics association Top 10 list for 2018.HEREDITARY was filled with darkness and dread, and Mr. Aster's second film begins with a similar setting: it's a dark and cold night as Dani (Florence Pugh, LADY MACBETH) frantically searches for her bi-polar sister through emails and phone calls. During her search, we realize that her relationship with boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor, SING STREET) is a bit strained. The brilliant pre-credit sequence results in a horrific tragedy striking Dani's family. Christian does his best to offer support, but he's a typically weasel of a man who feels more at ease hanging out with his grad school buddies than providing love and compassion to his needy girlfriend ... and he's not man enough to tell her, despite the urging of his friends.An awkward group conversation leads Dani to accept an invitation to go on the boys' trip to Sweden. The purpose of the trip is twofold: to participate in a 9 day long village festival held every 90 years and for Josh (William Jackson Harper, ""The Good Place"") to work on his thesis. The other guys in the group are Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren) whose family in Sweden is hosting the festival, and Mark (Will Poulter, THE REVENANT) who provides much of the comic relief thanks to his overall cluelessness about pretty much everything related to graceful societal interactions.And with that set-up comes one of the most deranged, unsettling and bizarre movie experiences this year (or most any year) is likely to bring. Try to picture a Folk Horror Comedy Fairy Tale Break-up Pagan Cult film, which at any given time reminds of MOTHER!, THE WICKER MAN, THE WIZARD OF OZ, THE VILLAGE, SUSPIRIA, and a handful of other cinematic oddities we've seen over the years. It is quite likely the sunniest horror film you've ever seen. And that's a literal description ... like the production could have been solar-powered. Most of it is filmed outside during Sweden's Midnight Sun - constant sunshine accompanied by mostly bright white skin and even brighter white cotton costumes (embroidered as if meant for Woodstock). The daylight messes with your senses and expectations. Bad things are supposed to happen in the dark, not in broad daylight enveloped by picturesque wonders of nature. Although the opening is cold, dark and punctuated with tragedy, the rest is so bright, it almost blinds you to the atrocities on screen.So without giving away anything, here's what we are in for: a welcome to Sweden mushroom trip, a Waco joke, a caged bear, a sacred tree, a Powerball game you hope to lose, and flowers and trees that seem to breathe. We also are reminded not to forget the birthday of our significant other, living to age 72 is not really rewarded in this commune, and no one should ever dance till they drop - even to be named the Queen of May. Of course, as with most horror films, it's easy to sit back as viewers and question the decision-making of the characters, but it's not like they realize they are in a horror film ... at least not until it's too late!Ms. Pugh (who reminds of another talented young actress, Haley Lu Richardson) is terrific here. Her character experiences shock, personal grief, a strained relationship, hallucinations, and a shot at revenge. The excellent music from Bobby Krlic, better known as The Haxan Cloak, is a mix of compositions and songs that create the mood for each character and scene. I was so shell-shocked at the end, that I'm unable to confirm that the version of ""The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine (Anymore)"" is that of The Walker Brothers (Scott Walker died earlier this year) or that of another band. Director Aster's second film proves the exaggerated and diverse spectrum of what constitutes a horror film, and cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelski's disorienting camera work perfectly complements a rare cinematic blend of frightening and funny. The cheery faces and pastoral beauty very nearly distract us from what might be the ugliest break-up movie ever.",positive
"Invited by their genial Swedish friend, four college students from New York take a vacation to rural Sweden to experience a Midsummer celebration at a commune. A couple of them are cultural anthropology students, who are naturally interested in the friendly isolated group and their odd ceremonies. The situation goes from friendly and curious to shocking. Florence Pugh and Jack Reynor play the American protagonists.""Midsommar"" (2019) is folk horror that plays out like ""The Wicker Man"" (1973/2006) meets ""The Village"" (2004) with elements of ""The Lords of Salem"" (2012). The topic of visiting a secluded pagan religious community and the increasing challenges thereof can be seen in other flicks like ""Ogre"" (2008), ""The Ritual"" (2017) and ""Apostle"" (2018), as well as the recent Indie ""Devil's Island"" (2021).If you like these kinds of movies ""Midsommar"" delivers the goods. Writer/director Ari Aster did his homework, combining fact with fiction, old and new. There's an insightful comparison between the lack of social intimacy in modern Western culture and the family-like camaraderie of the remote Commune. Pugh makes for an effective protagonist and there's some convincing gore. It's a professionally made piece no doubt.Unfortunately, the first half is more compelling than the second, which devolves into tedious ceremonies and the corresponding gobbledygook. Hammer's ""The Mummy"" (1959) had the same issue but was mercifully an hour shorter. ""Midsommar"" needed tightened up for a more gripping viewing experience, but directors generally don't like to cut scenes from their 'baby.'The film runs 2 hours, 27 minutes, and was shot in Budakeszi, Hungary (Hårga), as well as Korda Studios, Etyek, and Budapest, Hungary; Dani's apartment was shot in Brooklyn, New York.GRADE: B-",negative
"Much is been said about Midsommar. I now that I have finally seen it I do understand why. It's horror but not for everybody. people who are easily offended don't watch it. If you like your movies fast building, skip it because it is slow as hell.Doing that you are sucked with the characters into the Cult adoring the solstace. And just when you think, whatthe hell, the real horror comes in, and the gorehounds will love it. The rock scene will disgust many but those who dig ultra gore will love this. Further on you will have a love scene but how the cult react to that, another one that will disgust a lot.If you are into flicks about a cult and can stand gore and nudity then this is for you, otherwise you will left with a bitter feeling.Gore 5/5 Nudity 3/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",positive
"Soon after suffering a devastating family loss, Dani (Florence Pugh) decides to accompany her boyfriend and his friends to a remote village / commune in Sweden.

From this point everything unravels. Dani is also overwhelmed, yet eventually discovers her own destiny in a most unexpected way.MIDSOMMAR wears its influences proudly, especially the original WICKER MAN. In fact, this film would have fit in quite well in the early 1970's, when such unusual, even shocking fare was far more common. Director Ari Aster has made another psychological / occult horror gem, and like his first film, it's full of ominous foreshadowing and wicked surprises!Very effective and memorable...",positive
"First of all I'm glad I didn't pay too much attention to the negative reviewers on here. Normally I tend to listen more to the negative than the positive reviewers as often there are alot of fake positive reviews from people involved in a movie. But in this case the high rating it got from more then 100000 voters made me watch it, and I can't say I regret it. The cinematography is great, the acting is pretty good, and the story is captivating. I'm normally not a big fan of long movies, and in this case I even watched the director's cut that is 30 minutes longer, and never did I get a boring feeling. For that the story is too suspenseful, there is an evil dark ambiance to it that wants you to watch more. Movies about cults are most of the time interesting to watch as those people have a complete different lifestyle to ours, and mostly because they're deranged and/or brainwashed. Watching crazy people act weird, isn't that entertainment? To me it is for sure. Ari Aster did a very good job with this movie, that slow building tension all a long is brilliant. Personally I would have put a more oppressing and dark soundtrack to it, to make it more evil but that's just my opinion. Midsommar is a good movie in this genre, better than I thought it would be.",positive
"Obvious, it is a special film. For different motifs, from the performances, suggesting a new generation of actors ready to propose great roles to the realism of fight scenes, from the politic and the grew up of a young prince becoming an admirable king to the expected John Falstaff. In meny senses, the film of Timothee Chalamet . And one of splendid works from Neflix. So, just a great film, a wise storytelling, beautiful performances, fair atmosphere and something escaping to definitions. A film about power, maybe out of expected Shakespeare but profound inspired portrait of the battle of Azincourt. So, just special, in all of senses, at each level.",positive
"This is an interesting biopic of King Henry V. It starts when he is a ""playboy"" Prince of Wales. His father did not want him on the throne, but when his brother died, he was it.

"I never fully understood this when I was younger, but the saying is sort of telling us that everything is moving on. It's like saying after the game, is before the game. There is always a continuation, whether you or other persons are involved in that or not.And the same applies here. Timothee Chamolet is riding high (no pun intended) but he's not alone. The cast is amazing, the story gripping and there is enough to sustain your attention and be entertaining enough for the run time. For some if may have slower passages, but those are needed. Like a calm before the storm - also if you like medieval stuff and knights you don't even need me convincing you to watch this",positive
"This film is well made, and has a fairly engaging story. However, I find the pace too slow, and the static shots compound to the stillness that slows the film down.",positive
"At last an opportunity to see Timothée Chalamet doing something a little grittier. Sadly, t'was not to be. His portrayal of this great character from early 15th Century British history left me cold. He looked like a good meal would have killed him, never mind a bloodthirsty foe clad in iron armed with an axe. The accent held up reasonably well, but he still struggles to shake off the winsome, ""butter wouldn't melt"" image and as he has to pretty much carry this film en seul, it just doesn't really work. The rare appearances by Robert Pattinson border on the hammy; with his final appearance reminding me of the first few steps taken by ""Bambi"" back in 1942. It is great that Netflix are prepared to fund projects like this, but the plain truth is that no amount of money can compensate for a poor screenplay - think Shakespeare ""light"" - supplemented with a few high-profile cameo contributions.",negative
"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? was on TCM the other night. I re-watched a little bit of it, and then I had this brilliant idea that I wanted to make a new adaptation of it, but I don't like any of Edward Albee's dialogue, so I'm going to dump it all and write my own. It's going to ROCK, and I don't see how I could possibly fail. It's not like Albee's dialogue had anything to do with the success of his play.If you're going to give us yet another screen adaptation of ""Henry V"" (because apparently neither the Laurence Olivier or Kenneth Branagh versions exist) but you're not going to use Shakespeare's actual text, then the least I feel I deserve is a ""Henry V"" that feels like it has some reason for existence -- i.e. relevance to our current times. But this film doesn't have that. It's just full of a lot of cliche ""it's hard out here for a king"" ideas about leadership, politics, and war that we've heard a million times in a million better movies. ""The King"" looks handsome, but its own sense of self-importance is so cumbersome that watching it is like slogging through the mud that mires the English and French warriors fighting it out in the film's climactic battle.The film is slow and ponderous and its solemn tone never varies. Timothee Chalamet (as Hal) seems bored to be in this film, and his performance has a curious lack of energy. The first time we see him in the movie he's sleeping, and it's like he never fully wakes up. I'm sure his bedroom eyes could make a tweener swoon, but my goodness someone give the boy a sandwich and a jolt of caffeine. My wife could body slam this dude, and she's about 5'4"" and 120#.Joel Edgerton, who wrote the screenplay, plays Falstaff, but his primary purpose for being in the movie is to look gross. The film wants us to think the relationship of Falstaff and Hal is critical to the plot's outcome, but it doesn't ever feel like more than a sketch. In fact, that applies to the whole movie. I saw one review that described this movie as being a bunch of plot developments on an outline that no one ever bothered to connect to one another with substance, and that's a pretty apt description of my own experience watching it.With about five minutes of screen time, Robert Pattinson shows up late in the film (because he's obligated to appear in literally every movie released in 2019) and tries his hardest to inject some life into it by way of a Monty Python French accent. It's like he listened to all of director David Michod's notes on how to play the character and then was like ""nah."" He makes fun of Hal's penis size before beheading a child and then slipping around in some mud, and appears to be having a blast doing it. I'm glad he had fun, because someone connected to this film deserved to.Grade: C+",negative
"What a tedious movie. Terribly miscast, incomprehnsible dialog, often too dimly lit. Chalamet is too slender to be the heroic warrior king. So many other actors would have been better. In fact Rob and him should have changed places. Robert Pattinson is totally laughable as the buffoon like Dauphin would have made a better Henry and Chalamet as the Dauphin. The dialog is often incomrehensible. Why fake such heavy accents? Bad casting. The story is hard to follow unless you are familiar with the plays. Bad writer. Very modern expletives. The characters are had to differentiate. Bad director. The lighting is pitch dark or close to some scenes. Can't make out what is going on. The muddy battle isn't exciting because can't tell who is who. Lily Rose Depp as the queen is out of place with her exotic looks. Give this mess a miss.",negative
"As the movie opens, young Prince Hal (Timothée Chalamet) - the first son of King Henry IV of England - has left behind royal life and adopted his infamous ""wayward"" life. But soon thereafter his father's illness and eventual death brings him back to the court and ultimately puts him on the throne as King Henry V, immediately plunged into the complicated politics of the 15th century English court, with a desire to set right some of his father's wrongs, to establish the legitimacy of his reign and to achieve some of what his father had been unable to achieve - primarily to successfully claim the throne of France.Basically, the movie is well done technically. The sets and costumes give an authetic 15th century atmosphere, and the climactic Battle of Agincourt, in which the English (led by young Henry, by now King) defeated a much larger French army, is extremely well choreographed and it does accurately depict the use of the English longbow, which was in fact a much superior weapon to the cross bow used by the French, the use of which played a key role in the real Battle of Agincourt.) Having said that, the movie is also riddled with historical inaccuracies that are too numerous to recount here. Rather than being based on the historical record, ""The King"" is largely based on the relevant plays of William Shakespeare, which produces one of the greatest (because it was so central to the story) of the historical inaccuracies - the front and centre presence of Sir John Falstaff - who never existed, but was a fictional chartacter created by The Bard. So, if you're looking for a history lesson, you won't find it here except perhaps in very broad brushstrokes. Nor will you find a recounting of Shakespeare. This is more of a mish mash of some of Shakespeare's work, combined with a bit of history and a lot of historical licence.It's a tough slog at times to get through. I found it far too long at almost two and a half hours and there were times when it felt as though I could have skipped lengthy parts of this and not really missed very much of consequence. However the performances were good, and while I think it's a bit over-rated, I certainly wouldn't call this a bad movie, especially for those with an interest in the medieval era. (5/10)",negative
"A very different take on the story of King Henry V from the one we're used to seeing; you know the one a certain Mr Shakspeare has served up. As might be expected from a director who as already given us ""Animal Kingdom"" and ""The Rover"" there's a whiff of the gangster to be found here. These are the courts not of the high born but of the common, men who have fought their way to the throne through muddy fields of blood while Michod's vision of medieval Europe seems wholly accurate without being overdone.Of course, this is a Henry far removed from the nobility of an Olivier or a Branagh. Chalamet's Henry is certainly noble but he's also much more of a pragmatist, prepared to think first and act later, unlike Robert Pattinson's over-the-top and somewhat camp Dauphin; the contrast between them is beautifully delivered. The other main character is, naturally, Falstaff who, in Joel Edgerton's superb performance, is a much more subdued presence than we have seen before. Indeed the acting throughout is outstanding as is the screenplay co-written by Michod and Edgerton, while the Battle of Agincourt is as fierce and as bloody as any battle ever put on film. In an age of Marvel movies ""The King"" might seem like a fish out of water but it's unquestionably one of the best films of the year.",positive
"The King is getting compared to last year's 'The Outlaw King' quite a bit. Released on Netflix, period piece 'epic' war film, reluctant hero, etc. While certainly a fair comparison on the outskirts, I think The King deserves to be praised on its own merits, though both films are quite good. With a much slower burn, The King is a film largely about trying to fix the sins & mistakes of the previous reign/generation so that peace can be brought to the world, and it succeeds on almost every level at telling the story in that way. I was worried about Chalamet and Pattinson's accents, with only the latter feeling a tad off. But overall, this cast is magnificent, both leading men are surrounded by an incredibly talented character actor based group who know exactly what is needed of them to tell the story (or at least the beginning) of Henry V. Joel Edgerton absolutely steals this film from the get-go, and the final 15 minutes contain just enough surprises for the casual viewer. Loved this one.8.7/10",positive
"This turned out to be a pretty impressive movie, but then again, any film about Henry V that happens to have Falstaff in it is going to grab my attention. However, I should point out that this is only based on Shakespeare, this is not a rendition of any of the Shakesperian plays that centre around Henry V. The first thing is that Falstaff, at least in Shakespeare, doesn't go to France with Henry, and secondly the language in this film is somewhat more modern that what one generally gets with Shakespeare.The main focus of the film is the events that lead up to the battle of Agincourt, though at the beginning we are introduced to Hal as being the hard drinking, carousing, prince that we all know him as from the Henry IV plays. However, Falstaff, while being his good friend, is actually much more level headed, and much less of a buffoon in this film. In fact, as I mentioned, he travels with Henry over to France, as his personal advisor, much to the disdain of many in the court.There is a lot of political maneuvering in this film, particularly with Henry IV initially disinheriting Hal, but later being forced to accept him as king due to the death of his other son (and his other son basically died due to stupidity). However, a lot of the focus is the preparation, and the invasion, of France. As I mentioned, there is a lot of political maneauverings here, and it appears that the French are actually attempting to goad Henry into action, though it turns out that there is a lot more going on behind the scenes.One interesting thing in the film is how the battle of Agincourt played out. Look, I'm not entirely sure if the battle was actually filmed at Agincourt, because it certainly didn't look like it, but then again much of where the battle was fought has been turned into fields. Yet, in part it didn't seem like it went on for too long, and it certainly didn't feel as if there was a huge number of soldiers participating either. Personally, maybe that had something to do with budget constraints. Yet, the thing about the muddy ground, and the English using that to their advantage, certainly does add to the realism.Yeah, this turned out to be pretty cool film, and there was a lot of realism about it as well. It is certainly worth checking out.",positive
"This 15th century court and battlefield drama, oozing Shakespearean influence, is not entirely devoid of simple funny dialogue. Early in the story, receiving words from his half-delirious father King Henry IV (Ben Mendelsohn) asking him to come home, Prince Hal (Timothee Chalamet) bluntly tells the messenger that his father's requests will be ignored. When the messenger stresses that the request is urgent, Hal, walking briskly away and without breaking stride, shouts back ""The urgency is also ignored"".Another example. During Hal, now King Henry V lays siege on a French castle. One advisor comments that it is not advisable doing nothing and just waiting for the enemy's provisions to run out. Another advisor answers for the King ""This is the definition of a siege!"" But alas, such simple levity is few and far between.The main thrust of the plot is straightforward. As a juvenile delinquent of a prince, Hal is forced to face his newfound responsibilities upon the death of his father. Moreover, unlike KHIV, a reckless warmonger, KHV is a pacifist. Failed efforts to seek compromise ends in the fabled Battle of Agincourt where, against overwhelming odds, Hal defeats the army of the French Prince The Dauphin (Robert Pattinson), who, incidentally is just as delirious as his father KHIV.The above is an over-simplification of the movie which offers interesting subplots, anecdotes and characters. But first to my headline. While Chalamet enjoys his meaty lead role, Pattinson in his brief but scene-stealing role is the funniest as you have ever seen him, exaggerated French accent and all. In what ought to be a climactic duel between the two heartthrobs (half a generation apart?), we see The Dauphin, approaching Hal menacingly with raised sword, slips in the wet mud and stumbles under the weight of his full armour before he can deal a single blow. The sight is so pathetic that Hal sees no point in engaging him, but just orders his soldiers to finish him off.While there is a sizable support male characters including Joel Edgerton playing Hals' best friend John Falstaff who engineers the victory of the Battle, there are two female supports, both with very limited screen time but both turned in impressive performances.Thomasin McKenzie is Queen Philippa of Denmark, Hal's sister, warns him against people he believes that he can trust. Lily Rose-Depp plays Catherine de Valois the French princess that her defeated father offers to Hal in marriage. Anything but a damsel in distress, she is the one that makes him pay attention and try to grow up.The cinematography is too dark for my liking. Background music throughout comes from a string ensemble that leans heavily on the lower-registered instruments.",negative
"The King is a Biography - History movie in which we watch the story of Hal who is crowned King Henry V after the death of his tyrannical father. He has to learn about politics and the war that comes but also he has to control his past and his emotions from his life before becoming a king.I liked this movie very much because it is based on true history events and shows the dark details of not only the palace politics and interests but also behind the relationships and friendships between the people of the palace. I liked very much the interpretation of Timothée Chalamet who played as Hal / King Henry V and he was simply amazing. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Joel Edgerton's who played as Falstaff, Ben Mendelsohn's who played as Henry IV and Sean Harris' who played as William and they were all very good. Regarding the direction that was made by David Michôd, I have to say that it was very good, with much of suspense and action, and it was obvious that he studied the history behind the characters and their relationships between them in order to be correct and the result was this masterpiece.",positive
"The King (3.5 out of 5 stars).The King is a pretty fair historical drama film about King Henry IV of England. About a story when Henry gives his distant son Hal (Timothy Chalamet) the role of being king after his passing. Hal was always a drunk and distant son which Henry preferred his other younger son. Hal trying to correct the conflict that his father has left behind. He receives an insulting message from France. And an assassin sent by the French King. Which Hal prepares for war with the French.The plot is entertaining and worth watching if you care for historical dramas. Especially the story and setting taking place in the 15th century. The script and direction may be a little too long or prolonged in the second act of the movie. Which made it slow and boring in some parts.The acting is great with the performances by Timothy Chalamet as Hal. Joel Edgerton playing Falstaff, Hal's best friend and advisor. Sean Harris playing William, Hal's advisor. Ben Mendelsohn as the ill King Henry. And Robert Pattinson playing the Dauphin, the French King's son. Pattinson's performance as a French prince with the accent was something different.The direction of the historical drama is worth watching. The story behind King Henry's son Hal and his rise to ruling England and making it a peaceful place was good. There will be some slow parts which the film could have used some editing some scenes to help with the pace.The battle sequence is decent. It was a bit confusing with the chaotic battle with both armies crowding in. Making the characters feel claustrophobic and buried underneath the bodies.Overall, The King is a pretty fair film. The plot is good. The performances are great. And the direction is decent. The film suffers from weak pacing and prolonged scenes but it delivered telling this epic tale of these characters.",positive
"Since making his stunning debut with Australian classic Animal Kingdom in 2010, director David Michod has struggled to deliver a project to the same high standards he set for himself, with the good but not great The Rover and the genuinely lacklustre Brad Pitt starring War Machine failing to showcase the director we saw unearthed initially.It's pleasing then to see the Netflix released The King show more than its fair share of promise of the director we know exists, in what's a well-filmed, acted and staged epic that at times transcends itself to become a moving and contemplative examination of power and leadership as it shines a light on King Henry V.Teaming up with his long term friend and collaborator Joel Edgerton (who also makes his mark on screen as the no fuss John Falstaff), Michod and Edgerton craft a grim and grey insight into the time in which England found itself at war with France and under the leadership of a previously reluctant leader in the shape of Timothee Chalamet's Hal.There's nothing surprising about The King's narrative movements, one that feels similar to any other similar medieval epic, but Michod and Edgerton explore some interesting themes in amongst all the betrayals, beheadings, battles and bloodshed, that's expertly played out by a very capable cast.Continuing on his hot form that has now gone on for a number of years, Chalamet is well cast as Hal/Henry V and the way in which Chalamet moves from drunken slacker to a man determined not to make the same mistakes as his father is perfectly constructed, a performance that is backed up by the reliable Edgerton, a solid if underused Ben Mendelsohn as King Henry IV and a scenery chewing and thick accented Robert Pattinson as the detestable Dauphin of France.For a Netflix film, The King also feels a cut above a number of its other counterparts with Australian D.O.P Adam Arkapaw's cinematography capturing a mixture of beauty and horror effectively, while Nicholas Britell's thoughtful score ensures that Michod's vision is enhanced by some moody and atmospheric accompaniments.If there is a notable issue holding The King back from reaching a higher level of accomplishment, it would be that throughout, many of the films characters remain cold and unreachable, even Hal is a hard figure to completely fall for, while many of the films other players are never allowed to grow fully enough for us to invest ourselves in, had the film managed to instil itself with more of a beating heart (say like a Braveheart), its likely Michod would've finally had another Animal Kingdom on his hands.Final Say -A step in the right direction for director David Michod, The King is a well put together epic that should appease historians and fans of sword and sandal extravaganza's, that also features a number of solid acting turns that help maintain a constant level of engagement, without ever fully hooking us completely into its time and place.3 ½ rain predictions out of 5",positive
"Loosely based on Shakespeare's ""Henry IV: Parts 1 & 2,"" and ""Henry V,"" David Michôd's (""Animal Kingdom"") epic medieval drama The King lacks the Bard's poetry and soaring eloquence, yet its intensity, intimacy, and brooding power will keep you captivated throughout its 133-minute run time. Co-written by Michôd and Joel Edgerton (""Boy Erased""), the film is marked by the convincing performance of Timothée Chalamet (""Beautiful Boy"") as Prince Hal, later King Henry V, whose growth from a rebellious and ""uncourtly"" teenager into a king who commands respect and even fear is astonishing. Though the film departs from the Shakespeare play and the historical record, it is easily the equal of the ""Henry V"" films of Laurence Olivier and Kenneth Branagh in its ability to probe the depths of the royal mind.The King opens in court. Hal's rage against his father King Henry IV's (Ben Mendelsohn, ""Robin Hood"") obsession with internal wars in Scotland and Wales has caused him to leave the royal court and associate with John Falstaff (Edgerton) and his friends in the Eastcheap tavern. Unlike the cartoonish buffoon of Shakespeare's play, however, Falstaff is the king's trusted adviser and honest friend as well as a man of reason and deep military experience, serving to later remind the king of the ideals he espoused as Prince Hal. Though Hal's defeat of Henry Percy (Hotspur) (Tom Glynn-Carney, ""Tolkien"") in a sword fight saves his father's throne, his worthiness to become king is questioned by the dying King Henry IV who anoints Hal's younger brother Thomas of Lancaster (Dean-Charles Chapman, ""The Commuter"") as his successor.In the opening scene of the Shakespeare play ""Henry V,"" the Archbishop of Canterbury says ""The breath no sooner left his father's body, But that his wildness, mortified in him, Seem'd to die too."" When his father dies and Thomas is killed in Wales, Hal becomes King Henry V. As if the title brings with it a mythical power, Henry is transformed into a philosopher-king, more than ready to prove his right to rule. Determined to avoid patriotic wars, the new king ironically finds himself immediately embroiled in one. After an alleged assassination attempt and an insult by the Dauphin of France (Robert Pattinson, ""High Life""), Henry is ready to go to war with France.In the stirring epic battle at Agincourt in October 1415, immortalized by Shakespeare, the English soldiers are heavily outnumbered by the French led by the cocky Dauphin who taunts the monarch in a dubious French accent by saying, ""I enjoy to speak English. It is simple and ugly."" King Henry, however, relies on Falstaff's masterful military mind to win the battle against overwhelming odds, turning the conflict in his favor by use of his long-bowmen. Empowered by the cinematography of Adam Arkapaw (""The Light Between Oceans""), the costumes by Jane Petrie (""Suffragette""), and the relentless score by Nicholas Britell (""If Beale Street Could Talk""), the horrors of war are conveyed with graphic authenticity.Considered by some modern critics as a reckless warmonger, in Michôd's vision Henry V is the personification of England's triumph over internal dissension and foreign threats. The film, however, does not glorify war or turn it into poetry to inspire the troops. Here there is no battle of Harfleur with the stirring exhortation, ""Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more; Or close the wall up with our English dead,"" nor do we see the young king wearing a disguise to survey the troops opinions about whether or not the king's goals are justified.What we do see is Henry not only winning the battle but gaining the hand of French King Charles VI's daughter Princess Catherine of Valois (Lily-Rose Depp, ""Planetarium""). The outspoken princess boldly tells the English king that ""All monarchy is illegitimate"" and causes Henry to question his rationale for starting the war. In spite of England's success on the battlefield, however, Henry is an ambiguous figure whose manner of wielding power has raised questions as to whether he was a ruthless oppressor or a great liberator.Though it was within the rules of war in the fifteenth century, not a second thought seems to have been given to the order to put prisoners' heads on spikes, or to murder hundreds of French prisoners ostensibly because a number of English page boys were killed. Whatever our ultimate view of the character of Henry V is, it need not deter us from appreciating The King, a remarkable achievement and a big winner for Netflix.",positive
"The King possesses a few intriguing elements, but it just isn't as interesting or powerful as you'd expect. The result is a monotonous film that should've been exciting instead of dull. Setting and location production value was great, but the 140 min runtime was ridiculously and unnecessarily long, and felt even longer with the slow pacing. If this film was played at 1.5x speed, its shorter length and faster pacing would've made this film more entertaining. Many scenes were too long/dragged out. Director/writer David Michôd needed to make some serious edits and cuts to bring this film to a more ""suspenseful"" level (and length) of entertainment. Casting was excellent all around, especially Robert Pattinson who showed the most energy in his character, but I feel Timothée Chalamet was a poor choice for this role. It seemed like it was his first acting role with his stale, emotionless facial expressions and demeanor. A generous 6/10 from me.",negative

"(Flash Review)Without researching or dwelling on the facts, as many reviewers have complained about, this story is weighty and engaging. An unwilling prince Henry V is thrust by fate to the throne after his younger brother, designated to reign, is killed in battle. Future King Henry V has vision for peace for England while being pressed to take large swathes of land by force by his father's inner circle; namely all of France for starters. When a peaceful approach fails, the new King prepares for battle. Will the outnumbered English be able to defeat France's mature army? When the dust has settled and the blood finished dripping, who can he trust to forge his early reign? The atmosphere is full of darkly lit scenes also devoid of color; muted when used. The story's tone is portrayed serious and gritty with heavy music painting the mood. The acting, editing and production were high quality. Take the story for what it is and it'll be enjoyable.",negative
"This film start with a man ""Hotspur"" stabbing a man at the battlefield, the introduction of a England Prince ""Hal"" and his friend ""Falstaff"", and Hal's brother ""Thomas"" get kill and Hal's father ""Henry IV"" die by his illness scene! As turnout, this film is about Hal start a war with France to unite his own kingdom! Entire film quite slow and bored! The action in the film also low satisfaction and messy! Such as, first one, Hal fight with Hotspur and eventually kill him at the battlefield scene! This scene have some punching and Hal easily stab his opponent to death! Low satisfaction and not intense! Second one, the ending battle with France scene! This scene have some arrow shooting, punching and stabbing scene, but quite slow and messy! Very disappointed! Barely intense scene is, Hal chop off one of his own man's head scene! This scene show in detail! At the end, Hal and Falstaff fight with France's army! Falstaff kill by France's army! The prince of France ""Dauphin"" arrive, he step down from the horse and slipping at the mud! Hal order his army to kill him! At the very end, Hal found out the war with France actually is a lie setup by William, he kill William by stabbing William's head! That's it! Another disappointed film!",negative
"The story of Henry V, from inheriting the crown from his father to his famous victory at Agincourt.An often stirring, thoughtful and very serious telling of the tale which focusses predominantly on the strategies and smarts needed by the young king to get him through war with France and to understand the political necessities to be supreme ruler.The cast are excellent with particularly Harris as Henry's principal advisor and Edgerton as an enjoyable, albeit less comic than usual, Falstaff edging ahead. Chalamet is the tricky one and whilst he is a terrific actor and performs a great turn as Henry, occasionally it seems an uncomfortable fit.There is little to take issue with however. Edgerton's script is fine if a little flowery in places and fun though Pattinson is as the Dauphin, he seems as if he's auditioning for a Bond villain role.The film twists and turns quite nicely and is often quite violent, but overall it's a great tale, beautiful to look at and well told.",positive
"The King is a historical war drama movie directed by David Michod and stars Timothee Chalamet, Joel Edgerton, Robert Pattinson, Lily-Rose Depp and Sean Harris.Wow what a surprisingly great movie to watch. The movie is captivating and intense which is backed by strong acting and a great climax, some might complaint about the speed or the length of the movie but it can be ignored.For a movie to become a great movie there are some ingredients are required such as good plot, execution, acting and a fitting climax and this movie clears all the perimeter to become a good movie.The direction of the movie is good and the screenplay is slow yet engaging. Acting is one of the strongest aspect of the movie and Chalamet and Pattinson were superb. Cinematography is stunningly beautiful and the climax of the movie is strong. The movie should be known as the movie as one of the greatest war movies which is superbly supported by strong acting, great acting and superb execution. A must watch for all historical war movie lovers.",positive
"Watched it for Chalamet, stayed for Edgerton and Pattinson particularly the latter...I have been excited to see this ever since it was announced that Timothée Chalamet was going to be playing King Henry V, who as always is a triumph up on screen - he's the male Jennifer Lawrence, who keeps picking the meaty roles and will eventually land his Oscar (and rightly so) however it wont be for this role!Chalamet plays a character that soo many others have played over the year, yet he brings a subtlety and captivating performance - that at times i don't see anyone else on the screen.I am the furthest from a Robert Pattinson fan but somehow he had me eating out the palm of his hand as The Dauphin - campy, over the top and at times creepy. Yet his death scene was very lacklustre and i felt all this built up through the film was for nothing!Sean Harris as always excels playing Chief Justice William Gascoigne - theres a scene near the end that had me soo gripped just by how he completely embraced this character and went toe to toe with Chalamet.Joel Edgerton as Falstaff brings a much needed breath of fresh air into The King and for me is one of the biggest stand outs from the beginning.The battle scenes are directed brilliantly and gets you right in to the action - which at times is quite brutal but the cinematography adds a new dynamic that feels more rich and exuberant.The end battle in particular did give me Game of Thrones vibes which i also quite liked.Overall there are alot of peaks in The King which kept me gripped, however there are other movies in this genre i have watched over the years that i feel are better developed.",negative
First this movie is over 2 hours of a story that is stretched out much too long. And not one of the characters is even approaching being interesting.Second the cinematography is so dark it should have been recorded in black & white.Third 90% of the actors speak as if they are all coming down with laryngitis!Forth the story in itself is just a bore and I cannot see any public interest in it outside of the people that thrive on Medieval European history.Good luck if you choose to suffer this movie.,negative
"I'm glad I did check this out, because this film is certainly a step up from some of the Netflix releases I've seen from last year. To a point, I understand most of the middling reviews for this film. It's not perfect, far from it: it's a bit too long; Timothee Chalamet acts circles around everyone else on screen; and I will admit that some of the scenes in the first half of the film that feature Falstaff away from Hal are rather unnecessary. Some of the writing, too, feels a bit over-earnest, and at times a bit cheesy, but there are other moments where the writing soars (Chalamet's speech before the final battle). This film teetered on a 3.5/5 and 4/5 star rating the whole time I was writing my review, and I decided to give it a 4/5 star. There are issues with this film; I wont pretend there aren't. But this film also shows a lot of improvement over some of the direct-to-Netflix releases I've seen recently. I would much rather have films like this, that fall make a vie for greatness and fall just shy, than I would have a dozen more middling, soulless, committee-written-and-approved Marvel movies. This film might not be the one of the great medieval epics that will be remembered for years, but it's a step in the right direction for a company who has, at best, only put out decent movies so far.",positive
"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' sounded like it would be a great film from the get go. Although Quentin Tarantino's films have been spotty in recent years, his best work such as 'Reservoir Dogs' and especially 'Pulp Fiction' are masterpieces. The cast consists of many immensely talented actors. It looked great from the advertising and who cannot help resist that title. That it was one of the year's most positively received films further added to the interest.Although it is not quite perfect, 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' to me was as great as hoped. One of Tarantino's best in direction, writing and as a film as an overall whole in recent years, towards the better end of his filmography and one of 2019's best films, its positive reception richly deserved. It is unmistakable Tarantino in a good way and a great representation of the cast, with many giving some of their best work in recent years.Will start with the very, very few things that didn't quite come off for my tastes. Some of the pace, especially for a film as long as it was, could have tightened and not every scene felt necessary. Actually would have trimmed some or all of Sharon Tate in the cinema, regardless of how beguiling the production values and Margot Robbie's (that smile is a beauty) acting were.Did think too that the Bruce Lee caricature and encounter were quite tasteless and anybody who was offended can't be blamed.That sounds like a film worth a 7 or 8 out of 10. The good things though were so amazing and the film was in a different league to a lot of films released this year that to me awarding 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' either of those scores felt too low. It looks wonderful, dazzlingly shot with shots filled to the brim with atmosphere, stylishly edited with a lovingly recreated period. Tarantino directs with great confidence and his distinctive style is all over it. The music is used sparingly, but the music choices are very effective when used. Particularly so the quite sinister use of ""Twelve Thirty"" in a scene that already makes one feel unnerved.Script has the hard-boiled edge necessary and has entertainment and intensity. A word of warning, there is a lot of profanity (am mentioning this because this is something that bothers people) but to me it didn't feel as gratuitous as feared. Some pacing issues aside, the story is often absorbing and is quite nostalgic and daring with expert melding of fact and fiction. A few great scenes are everything to do with the making of the western with Rick and the girl (fans of classic-era westerns will enjoy it, likewise anybody with super fond memories of episodic television), Cliff's truly chilling encounter at the Spahn Movie Ranch and the splendidly over the top (and extremely violent just to warn you) finale in true Tarantino style.Found the characters to be interesting, with Rick and Cliff being quite meaty roles. The acting is exemplary, Leonardo DiCaprio is charisma and intensity personified and Brad Pitt, here the epitome of cool, has not been this good in years. Margot Robbie is absolutely radiant with a smile that lights up the screen. Bruce Dern, Damian Lewis and Al Pacino provide delicious support in small roles.In conclusion, the odd pacing issue and one tasteless scene aside this was a great film. 9/10",positive
Quentin Tarantino has given us a masterpiece with an historic teaming of Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt. The two really work well together and that's half the secret of this film.The other half is incredible detail to the period of this movie which takes place in 1969 Hollywood. DiCaprio plays a former western star who would like to get his career jump started again. I remember back in the 50s and early 60s television was saturated with westerns. DiCaprio is playing one of those stars and westerns had gone into a decline as public taste has changed. But there are a few being made still and DiCaprio is shooting an episode in Lancer.Back in the day Brad Pitt was his stunt double and now he's gotten older and heavier and he's a iconoclastic sort.and he's essentially DiCaprio's entourage. These two are so great together in every scene they're both in.As it turns out DiCaprio lives in a Beverly Hills cul-de-sac and his neighbors are Roman Polanski and his wife the ill fated Sharon Tate played her by Margot Robbie. There's this aura of tragedy that Tarantino creates around her and her friend hairstylist to the star Jay Sebring played by Emile Hirsch. For one who in her short career played some sexpots there's a sweet innocence in Robbie's portrayal of Tate.Also note good performances by Al Pacino as a producer always on the cutting edge of new trends in the business. And Bruce Dern is unforgettable as George Spahn who owned the movie ranch property where many westerns were shot back in the day. Dern has a memorable scene with Pitt.There might definitely be some Oscars in this one. See it by all means.,positive
"ONCE UPON A TIME... IN HOLLYWOOD is Tarantino's latest epic movie and thankfully much better than THE HATEFUL EIGHT. I find the director hit or miss in recent years, but this is his best since INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS and one of his most satisfying creations. It's nothing less than his love letter to all things 1960s, and is a film chock-full of cultural references and an ensemble cast with a reliance on famous actors of yesteryear playing small roles. I particularly enjoyed the way Tarantino gets the opportunity to reference Italian genre cinema, a love of mine also. The plot is a real slow-burner and the middle section sags quite a bit, with endless scenes of DiCaprio shooting his scenes which add nothing to character or plot. However, Tarantino reins it in for the last hour and builds tension before letting rip with an incredibly violent and incredibly satisfying climax.",positive
"It's 1969 Hollywood. Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a former TV western star and Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) is his stunt double. Dalton's career is on a downward slide and Booth is also his driver. Dalton discovers that he is living next to famed director Roman Polanski and his actress wife Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie). Booth is taken with Pussycat (Margaret Qualley) who happens to be a Manson girl.There is only one section of true tension. It's Cliff Booth going to see George at the ranch. The ranch is the best section of the movie. Dalton and Booth have a fascinating chemistry. Brad Pitt may indeed be too pretty to be a stuntman. All of this leads me to conclude that it would be interesting to have Booth go back to the ranch to save George from the hippies. He can shoot them all and have a smoke. Quite frankly, the reworking of the climatic incident lacks the power of the Hitler cinema. I also don't like this Bruce Lee. It reminds me of all the copycat Bruce after his death and I doubt he would do a flying kick to start the fight. Obviously, Tarantino is reworking the legendary Bruce Lee incident but it feels wrong. Tex also feels wrong. There is a reason to rework Hitler for a revenge porn. There is no reason to rework Bruce Lee and if he's reworking the Manson family, he may as well rework it to its full extent. Quite frankly, Mindhunter gives an alternate version of Manson which is infinitely more compelling than this. Tarantino has more than enough skills but he would have more freedom to do a lesser known crime.",negative
"I don't know what to say about the plot. It meandered but it didn't matter to me. At some point I begin to hone in on the two principle characters. Watching Pitt and DiCaprio ply their trade was masterful to watch. Neither of them is admirable. DiCaprio's character is sullen and selfish and has no self esteem. Pitt is the mad man whose skills as a stunt man have held him in reasonable stead for a long time. He is so loyal and never wavers, even when his friend has no use for him. The whole Manson thing is interesting because we get a picture of the Spahn ranch and the activities going on there. I know there is little plot but it is episodic, focusing on the two men and their crazy world.",negative
"Each film by Quentin Tarantino is provocative. But in this case, the test is more tough because the first large part of the movie has high chances to be boring or so far by what you expect. But this is its fundamental virtue / a galery of portraits, nice, realistics, eccentrics , proposing not only a hommage to old Hollywood but reflection about cinema . The portrait of Sharon Tate is one of the precious gifts of the film. The admirable work and fine collaboration between Brad Pitt and Leonardo di Caprio is other. Sure, in the last part, what you expect, you have. But the film remains special in so many senses, than it deserves to not be ignored , giving explanation to the essence of the cinematography,at the level of influences and fascinations of Tarantino. That does it provocative in real sense.",positive
"Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood is an American movie from 2019, so still really fresh and new and this is without a doubt gonna be a big player this awards season. The reason is of course that the man in charge here of script and direction was a certain Quentin Tarantino. There are some parallels and some differences compared to his other recent films. First of all the movie takes us again back in time, but this time not as far as the days of slavery and also not even as far as the days of WWII, but ""only"" into the year 1969. Like with other (recent) films from him, it is really long, clocks in at over 2.5 hours, but also as with other films from him, it does not feel this long because of how good it is. Looking at the cast, you will find familiar names you have seen in Tarantino films not too long ago. DiCaprio was a key supporting player in his previous work, Brad Pitt was in the one before that. If you pay close enough attention, you will also see brief appearances by Tarantino regulars Russell, Madsen and Bell. Tim Roth also shot scenes, but they were deleted sadly. Still you can see Tarantino is a loyal filmmaker when it comes to who he casts, not Fassbinder level maybe, but still. But there are also other actors in here who (I think) have not been in Q's works before. This includes the great Al Pacino and Bruce Dern who I like as well and who has one scene only in here. I also liked to see Timothy Olyphant in here as I really adored him on Justified and it's kinda fitting he plays in here in a year when a Deadwood movie was made and became quite a success. Also he's on Fargo now, so his career is going strong. Dakota Fanning many will recognize here, but she did not do too much for me. I have always been more of an Elle Fan(ning).Who else? Oh yeah Luke Perry who sadly died not too long ago has also one scene here together with DiCaprio. Emile Hirsch was okay. Damien Lewis, well I have never been a big Homeland fan admittedly, even when he was on it, but his one-scene turn as Steve McQueen was pretty hilarious how they talk about Sharon Tate's taste in men. And there we have the name of the central female character already, namely the one played by recent Oscar nominee Margot Robbie, certainly one of the hottest actresses on the planet right now, well I mean in terms of how much people are interested in their talent, not only in their looks, even if I as somebody with a preference in dark-haired girls cannot call her unattractive either. She is stunning. And while I was not really won over by her acting talent after Scorsese's Wolf of Wall Street, her role selections as Harley Quinn, Tonya Harding and now Sharon Tate were not only daring, but also she really made a lot with these characters honestly and she was memorable in this film here too, which was admittedly impressive because she had far from the baity material Pitt and DiCaprio did. Maybe the reason was that she rarely had to share the screen with others or at least not with others who really took the spotlight away from her and with that also I mean Polanski, who wasn't present anyway in the key scene at the theater (that was all hers) and also at the end of course.So you already saw I mentioned several scenes that really made an impact, but even if the overall outcome and congruent story line was certainly not bad, it was not nearly as great as the individual scenes, but then again that is really something that applies to almost every Tarantino film. I will mention another handful of scenes that stay(ed) in the mind. The one I think of immediately is the one with the child actress, the little girl who plays the character that DiCaprio's character in character holds hostage. This hostage scene with how amazed she is by him and his performance and improvisation is also pretty good, but not nearly half as good as their first meeting that is about the books they read, especially about the book Rick (LDC) reads and in which the main character stands for DiCaprio's character himself. I mean Leo was good there too, but the girl was a true scene stealer. The name is Julia Butters and I am truly curious about what we will see from her in decades to come. I hope she stays in the industry and of course stays as great as she was here. Then also the flame thrower scene. That was also pretty funny earlier when Rick Dalton asks if they can turn the temperature a bit down and the guy working there says something like ""Rick, it is a flame thrower"", but again of course when Tarantino picks up on this gadget near the end with one of the intruders being at the wrong end of it. It's pretty hilarious and epic when Leo comes out with it in his hands and I laughed a lot.Now I mentioned Leo a lot, but the one who deserves at least as much praise here is Brad Pitt who finally seems to have managed to cut himself loose from the ugly aftermath of his marriage to Angelina Jolie and has two promising films and performances coming out here. So Pitt had many memorable scenes too and he gives it the right approach without a doubt. I am talking about the moment he pushes Bruce Lee into an expensive car, the scenes with the hot young girl (now I am not sure I could have resisted her) and what followed in what looked like outback when he goes to visit Dern's character. There it was a typical scene when you expected some escalation or anything because of how tense the atmosphere was, but it stayed all relatively harmless surprisingly except the tyre changing perhaps at the end. And with Pitt you also have to mention the scenes at the house of course with his dog. I mean nobody can make a starving dog seem as entertaining as Tarantino that much is safe. The dog wasn't even cute and still I could not look away. As for the end, it is really violent, but this is also Tarantino and if that keeps you from watching the entire film, then that's your loss. Like, REALLY violent with what happens to two of the three intruders. I won't go into detail, but lets just say the dog is not a chihuahua and Pitt's character basically the canine's human equivalent. Last two movies it was the racists and the Nazis (well they are racists too aren't they?) who really got punished hard, this time it is the satanists.Okay what else can I say here. I mean Tarantino is a big film junkie and film fan everybody knows, so no surprise you can literally see on the screen how much fun he had making a film about the movies here (even if in the broadest sense Basterds was that too, but not to such an extent). As a consequence, it is packed with interesting and captivating references about the world of movies, not just about Polanski and Rosemary's Baby, but a lot different stuff too. And Tarantino used many fun songs for this one too. Not the film's greatest strength, but only because other aspects were better. As for the ending, you never knew where this was heading. Obviously he would not give us an authentic retelling of the events that night when super-pregnant Sharon Tate was killed in cold blood by Manson's helpers, but instead his own take, his fictitious take on things. This alone should be obvious already by the use of Dalton and Cliff Booth (Pitt) who I believe are completely fictitious characters, so no surprise that the ending also had nothing to do with how things went that night. I usually hate unrealistic fake endings for the only purpose to have audiences leave the theater with a smile, but this is totally not it here. It was a great choice and execution as we see Rick enter Tate's house to play cards or so with the gang. Actually what he dreamt of as he mentioned earlier to be included in her and Polanski's circle of friends. As for Leo, the film also could have ended already for all I care the moment when he is totally moved by the compliment from the young actress as he did not add too much later on again, well except the flame thrower scene of course. That alone was worth it to continue his story line in the pool.Okay now, I started my review to talk about awards attention and I will finish it like that too. I am not sure if this film will give Tarantino another screenplay Oscar, but a nomination seems really safe and a win also possible. Some even list him first for Best Director at the Academy Awards, but even if i thought this was mostly a great watch I am not sure this should be the film that gets him his first director Oscar. It is not his best work, maybe not even Top3, but good to see him this strong again in his mid 50s and if it takes like five years between his movies always, then I am really looking forward to his next effort already when he will be like 60. Maybe Kill Bill 3? Come on Quentin, we've been waiting for it so long. Anyway, as for the awards, Brad Pitt is considered a frontrunner for the Supporting Actor Oscar right now at this admittedly really early stage, but I am also a bit skeptical here. I mean he was good and all, but is it a performance that really stands out in his career compared to other stuff he did? I don't know. But it would not be entirely undeserving I guess. Same with Robbie who had a more difficult challenge here than it seems to the untrained eye I think. As for the film's Best Picture chances, I will wait with a final verdict there. It is in my top3 right now from 2019 with the other two having no chance to win Best Picture, but lets see what I think about the other nominees, such as Scorsese's new film of course. Okay back to Hollywood now, very fitting that Tarantino claimed this film title after OUATI the West and OUATI New York and he sure is deserving and what he did with this movie is more than just repectable. So overall, a big thumbs-up. Do I even have to say this one gets a bold positive recommendation from me? It's Q after all. Watch. Highly recommended.",positive
"Once Upon a Time ...in Hollywood is one of the most overrated film released by Hollywood industry. The hype is difficult to be understood but certainly has influenced those puppets that like to read the professional reviews to have their own opinion. The screenplay is boring and the good point is the references to films and the soundtrack based on the 60's. As usual in Quentin Tarantino's films, the cast is impressive. But this time, the film is a great disappointment. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): 'Era Uma Vez em... Hollywood"" (""Once Upon a Time ...in Hollywood"")",negative
"Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood is maybe proof that Quentin Tarantino ranks alongside Stanley Kubrick. Both started to make overlong movies and were lionised by critics, many who were afraid to be critical of them.This might be Tarantino's most self indulgent film so far despite being a glorious period piece.Set in Los Angeles 1969. The film is an alternate history as it focuses on Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) who was once a star of the hit television show Bounty Law. Now Dalton's career is fading. He drinks too much, he does not remember his lines and his regular work is guest starring as the villain of the week.Accompanying Dalton is his stunt double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) who acts as his driver and gofer. Booth is also short of work as he has a bad reputation in the stunt industry.Living next door to Dalton in LA is actress Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) who has just moved in with her director husband Roman Polanski. Life for her is attending parties and going to the cinema to see her latest movie.Dalton wonders if he should take up a suggestion to go and work in Italy and make spaghetti westerns which could kick start his career. Booth gave a pretty hippy a lift to a ranch which is full of strange people belonging to a cult. Booth seemed to have rubbed them up the wrong way.Eventually the various people cross paths in this reimagining of what might have happened on a fateful night in 1969.There is no doubt that that DiCaprio and Pitt give their all in this film as two middle aged men fading away at an uncertain time. Tarantino seems to have given this film a conservative hue, he really dislikes the counterculture. I wonder if he is angry with the #metoo movement which destroyed his friend Harvey Weinstein and raised questions over his own conduct in the past.Clocking in at under 3 hours this film meanders until it reaches its explosive climax. Until then you wonder what exactly is the story. The movie is a series of vignettes that hints at a director/screenwriter who is past his prime and seems to be obsessed with bare feet.",negative
"I approached this film not knowing too much about it, although I was a little aware of the Manson murders, Sharon Tate, and the fact that this film was loosely set around those events, but very much a fictional version of them (or a total fairy tale as is suggested by the title). Watching the film needed me to invest in that approach from the very start, because it is a nostalgic imagining of a better time without much of a connection to reality. This is made reasonably clear throughout by the insertion of the characters into real shows and films of the era, and of course by significant elements of the ending, which changes history somewhat.What is less clear is 'why' the film is doing this. It produces a reasonably enjoyable film with plenty to enjoy in the moment, in the performances, and in the overall delivery, but in terms of narrative flow it feels so fragmented and unfocused that it is hard to stick with it for such a long running time. Almost all of the scenes are engaging in some way, but as a whole they do not come together; even the extreme revision of history seems like it lacks a specific point or message for the casual viewer. It was a distancing effect on me because I enjoyed all these moments but yet was happy in them without caring really for what came next.The performances are strong. Pitt is good (although I was surprised by his Oscar) but I found DiCaprio to be the stronger performance as he had more character to get his teeth into. Robbie is a cheery presence, but only that - she isn't really a character so much as a frame of reference that we have to like; as such she works, but it doesn't sit well in the film because there is a lot of oddity when it comes to the handling of characters. The women are consistently fawned over, with a particularly weird focus on feet almost every chance it gets. Likewise the female characters bring less to the film, and are much more 'devices' than even some male characters with very little screen time.In the end, it is still a solid movie with plenty to like about it, but this is almost in spite of itself. It has unforced problems, seems rambling and messy, and relies a lot on the sheer force of its talent (cast and crew) to make the film work as well as it does - but this isn't well enough for something this long that doesn't have a strong enough narrative through-line.",positive
"Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) is an ex-TV cowboy with a waning career. His go-fer buddy and stunt double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) has fallen on worse times, but life still goes on in 1969. They live near the Roman Polanski residence with the Manson family lurking in the background. History tells us what happens. The only question is how will Quentin Tarantino present it.I liked how the film captured the stars. You can tell whom they were even without their name being mentioned or they have a credit, such as the woman with the Joey Heatherton hair at the Playboy Mansion. Damon Herriman was not convincing as Charlie.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity",positive
"Let's get some things off my chest from the start. The movie itself felt like it could have been shorter. It didn't seem necessary to be so long. Also I am in the corner of people not happy about the depiction of Bruce Lee and the ""excuse"" Tarantino came up with didn't really help that cause (first saying it's just fiction to then go on saying Bruce was like that/the way he portrayed him). Let's be clear, I never met Bruce, but the way he was depicted in here, felt disrespectful at times (making him look dumb for a joke that is also in the trailer).Having said all that, you do get the Tarantino genius and his flavor is there and can be seen overall. A friend commented on a scene (a dog being fed) and likened it to the relationship between Tarantino and the viewer. QT being Brad Pitt in that situation and the viewer of the movie being the dog. Patience is something that is rare and also something that Tarantino may not find in many viewers either.Acting is superb, editing is great and the story while far removed from the actual events, is fun to watch. So don't expect historical accuracy also don't expect Margot Robbie to talk much. That doesn't mean she doesn't have an impact. It also doesn't mean QT is sexist. It's just another thing critics will latch onto since there's no motherf'in Samuel L. Jackson here to just spew the n word.While mostly slow and really mellow, there are some violent moments in here that may be too much for some viewers. Be warned, this is Tarantino after all. And he can get explicit in his depiction of violence. This is also a movie that is able to grow on you, even after initial rejection ... but that will be up to you and your willlingness to think about it way after you watched it",positive
"This film felt like it went on for a very long time, if I'm truly honest my interest in Tarantino films has dropped off in recent years, not intentionally, but there you go.This didn't exactly do much to reignite the spark, for an hour and a half I was mildly entertained, perhaps a little bored. The last half an hour or so sees the film go up several gears, the ending was great, the best part of the film.The major strengths here, the visuals, if you love the sixties, this will appeal to you, it looks incredible, the visuals are sublime. The acting is awesome, not a single quibble from me about the acting, DiCaprio is absolutely superb, and deserving of accolades.A good story, the issue for me was pacing, the story takes time to hot up, and if I'm honest, beging to knit together.It's a good film, you just need to stick with it. 6/10.",positive
"Well I'm a big Tarantino fan, but I have to say, this one missed the mark for me. I thought the movie's pacing was excruciating, as most of the time nothing seemed to be happening. I didn't know anything about the story going in, so as it unfolded I was able to figure out that it had something to do with the Manson Gang, which had me prepared for a typically violent crescendo as the story came to a climax. However the film opted for an alternate reality to the actual events of August, 1969. This version had the Manson followers wind up at the wrong house, to be met with a fading television actor and his regular stunt double, dishing out punishment in true Tarantino style. By that time, my only reaction was to laugh at the absurdity of it all, what with Brad Pitt hammering his victim mercilessly into any available furniture, while Leonardo DiCaprio whipped out his trusty flame thrower to nail the chick in the swimming pool. Not bad for the guy who broke down on the set of 'Lancer' when he couldn't deliver his lines right.In passing, the actors who portrayed Steve McQueen and Bruce Lee had an eerie way of channeling the former celebrities. Damian Lewis couldn't have been a better choice to mimic McQueen, he had the look and mannerisms that had me thinking he could have been the real deal. Mike Moh in some ways, looked more like Jason Scott Lee portraying Bruce Lee in the movie ""Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story"". I read that the family of Bruce Lee wasn't happy with the way Tarantino represented the former martial arts star in the film, but if that's the case, the same would have to be said of 'Dragon' because Jason Lee's interpretation to my mind was pretty much the same.For nostalgia fans like myself, the film has some merit in reliving the names of old time TV and movie programs like 'Mannix', and Steve McQueen's 'Wanted:Dead or Alive', reinvented for this picture as 'Bounty Law'. There's also the 'Lancer' spot with Timothy Olyphant portraying that series' star, James Stacy. Margot Robbie was stunning as Sharon Tate, and if Tarantino had been a little sharper, he might have thrown in a plug for the only Sharon Tate film I've ever seen, 1967's ""The Fearless Vampire Killers"". But unfortunately, just like that old horror comedy, this story was sooooo long, with interminable scenes stretching the distance from one point to another, it felt a lot like those old horse chase scenes did in 'B' Westerns from the Thirties and Forties.",negative
"Quentin Tarantino gives us another tribute to lowbrow entertainment, this time an homage to Hollywood's transition to mature material. ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"" focuses on an actor (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his stunt double (Brad Pitt) in 1969 Los Angeles, a bastion of hippies, old-school agents, and the Mansons...and the protagonist lives next door to Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie).This brings to mind all the things that happened in summer 1969. The obvious one is the Manson family's deeds, but there was also Judy Garland's death (and the subsequent Stonewall uprising), the moon landing, and Woodstock. And just as the world was about to move into autumn, Moammar Qaddafi seized power in Libya. What a world it must've been (for the record, I was born long after the '60s). As ""Alice's Restaurant"" reminded us, every generation has a story to tell.Anyway, it's an impressive movie. I hope that it wins at least one Oscar.",positive
"Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, The Hateful Eight) has said over the years he will retire from filmmaking after completing ten films, this is his ninth (although, you could also count Four Rooms, Sin City, and Death Proof). Basically, set in 1969, Rick Dalton (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Leonardo DiCaprio) is a former 1950s television actor, most famous for the Western TV show Bounty Law. He has made the move to Hollywood movie making, but fears his career is over. Casting agent Marvin Schwarz (Al Pacino) suggests he make Spaghetti Westerns, but Dalton fells this is beneath him. Dalton's friend and stunt man Cliff Booth (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Brad Pitt) lives a simple life, without glitz and glamour, in a trailer. He works for Dalton as his driver, as Dalton is an alcoholic, and has been arrested too often for drink driving. Booth has had no film work since the death of his wife, and rumours suggest he may have murdered her. Actress Sharon Tate (BAFTA nominated Margot Robbie) and her husband, film director Roman Polanski (Rafal Zawierucha), have moved into the house next door to Dalton's, on Cielo Drive. Dalton hopes to befriend the couple to restore his status. That night, Tate and Polanski join Jay Sebring (Emile Hirsch) at a celebrity-filled party at the Playboy Mansion. The next day, Booth repairs Dalton's TV antenna, and reminisces about a sparring match he had with Bruce Lee (Mike Moh) on the set of The Green Hornet, which resulted in Booth being fired. Charles Manson (Damon Herriman) stops by Polanski and Tate's house looking for record producer Terry Melcher, who used to live there, but is turned away by Sebring. One day, while driving Dalton's car, Booth picks up young hitchhiker Pussycat (Margaret Qualley). He drops her off at Spahn Ranch, once a location for Bounty Law. Booth is suspicious of the large number of hippies squatting on the property (the Manson Family), and suspects they are taking advantage of the owner, George Spahn (Bruce Dern). Booth insists on checking on Spahn despite objections from Squeaky Fromme (Dakota Fanning). Spahn is blind and acts cantankerous towards Booth but assures him he is fine. Returning to the car, Booth discovers a tire has been slashed by Clem Grogan (James Landry Hébert), he beats him and forces him to change it. One of the girls, Sundance (Cassidy Hice), fetches Charles ""Tex"" Watson (Austin Butler), but by the time he arrives on horseback Booth is driving away. Tate sees her movie, The Wrecking Crew, is playing at the local theatre, and decides to stop there to watch herself, and see and hear the audience reactions. Dalton lands the role of a villain in the pilot episode of a new series, Lancer. He strikes up a conversation with his eight-year-old co-star, Trudi Fraser (Julia Butters), who sees herself as a method actor. During one scene, Dalton is hungover, and struggles to remember his lines. Dalton has a breakdown in his trailer but returns to the set and delivers a powerful performance that impresses the director, Sam Wanamaker (Nicholas Hammond), and Fraser, this boosts Dalton's confidence. After watching Dalton's guest performance on an episode of The F.B.I., Schwarz books him to star as the lead of Sergio Corbucci's next Western, Nebraska Jim. Dalton takes Booth with him for a six-month stint in Europe, during which he appears in two additional Westerns and a spy comedy, and he marries Italian starlet Francesca Capucci (Lorenza Izzo). Returning to Los Angeles, Dalton informs Booth he can no longer afford his services, and they agree to part ways. After having drinks, they return home, where Booth finds the acid-laced cigarette given to him by Pussycat, he smokes it and takes Brandy the dog for a walk. Tate is heavily pregnant, and has a small gathering with Jay, and their friends Wojciech Frykowski (Costa Ronin) and Abigail Folger (Samantha Robinson). On a night in August, the Manson Family: Watson, Susan ""Sadie"" Atkins (Mikey Madison), Linda ""Flower Child"" Kasabian (Maya Hawke), and Patricia ""Katie"" Krenwinkel (Madisen Beaty) park outside in preparation to murder everyone in Tate's house. Dalton hears the car and angrily orders them to leave. The group decides to kill Dalton instead, after Atkins reasons that Hollywood ""taught them to murder"". Kasabian deserts the group, while the others break into Dalton's house, Capucci panics, and Booth recognises them from Spahn Ranch. Booth orders Brandy to attack, Krenwinkel and Watson are killed, while Atkins is severely injured. Dalton, who was listening to music on headphones, is oblivious to the mayhem. He is alerted when Atkins stumbles outside with a gun in her hand, falling into the swimming pool. Panicked, he retrieves a flamethrower kept from a film shoot and incinerates Atkins. After Booth is hospitalised and Capucci goes back to sleep, Sebring engages Dalton in conversation. Tate invites Dalton over for drinks with her houseguests. Also starring Kurt Russell as Randy, Timothy Olyphant as James Stacy, Luke Perry (posthumous, in his final role) as Wayne Maunder, Damian Lewis as Steve McQueen, Lena Dunham as Gypsy, Zoë Bell as Janet, Dreama Walker as Connie Stevens, Rumer Willis as Joanna Pettet, Scoot McNairy as Business Bob Gilbert, Michael Madsen as Sheriff Hackett on Bounty Law, Clifton Collins Jr. as Ernesto the Mexican Vaquero, James Remar as Ugly Owl Hoot on Bounty Law, Tim Roth (scene deleted, but still credited), Harley Quinn Smith (Kevin Smith's daughter) as ""Froggie"" and the voice of Quentin Tarantino as the director of the Red Apple cigarettes advertisement. DiCaprio is most impressive as the down-trodden actor, Pitt is likeable as his stunt man and gopher friend, and Robbie is charming as real-life character Sharon Tate, and the ensemble cast all do well also. The main focus is slightly more on the DiCaprio and Pitt characters, seeing how they get on during the final moments of ""Hollywood's Golden Age"", the real-life Sharon Tate/Manson Family story only one component of an audacious, surprising and mind-bending narrative. It does exactly the same as Inglorious Basterds, plays with the facts, and gives us a ""what if"" scenario (what if the Manson Family went to the wrong house on Cielo Drive?). It works well as a homage to the changing times of Hollywood, it is a more melancholy and mature film from Tarantino, but obviously we get some trademark violence and over-the-top flamboyant moments to keep fans happy, overall it is a most interesting and watchable comedy-drama. It won the Oscar for Best Production Design, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Original Screenplay for Quentin Tarantino, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Sound Editing, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film, Best Original Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Production Design, Best Costume Design, and Best Casting, and it won the Golden Globe for Golden Globe Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy, and Best Screenplay. Very good!",positive
"Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood has been receiving some great reviews (it's currently rated 8.3 here on IMDb), but I think it's one of Tarantino's weakest movies. For well over two hours, virtually nothing of interest happens: as much as I didn't particularly enjoy Kill Bill Pt 2, Death Proof or Jackie Brown, I can't say I was bored, but OUATIH is just that -- boring! There's none of Tarantino's sparkling dialogue, no iconic scenes, and the ending simply pulls off the same trick that the director employed in Inglourious Basterds -- changing history (only in this instance, it all seems to be in questionable taste given what really happened fifty years ago).As a fan of cult movies, Italian westerns, Bruce Lee and old TV shows, and as someone with an interest in the Manson murders, I fully expected to be enthralled by Tarantino's re-creation of 60s Hollywood, its colourful characters, and one of the darkest moments in its history, but was totally taken aback by how mundane this movie is. If you want to watch Brad Pitt feed his dog, mend a TV aerial and drive a car, then this is the movie for you; if you want to see Leonardo DiCaprio talk about books to an 8 year old and record an episode of a dull TV western (a scene that went on way too long) then have at it. I think that if this is the standard of movie that Tarantino is dishing up, he should call it quits at nine.4/10 for the face-smashing, dog-biting, flame-throwing finalé, which actually perked me up. But that's being generous.",negative
"I watched this at home on BluRay from my public library, my wife skipped. Then I watched it again 4 days later. You get so much more after you know what to expect. With as much press this movie has received, including just winning the Golden Globe for Best Picture, I was skeptical, I was prepared for a letdown. But I wasn't, I thoroughly enjoyed and was entertained by its 2 hour and 40 minute running time.The year 1969 is memorable for a number of reasons, the moon landing, my finishing graduate school, the Chappaquiddick incident, my first daughter being born. And also Sharon Tate. The story here comes to a climax on August 9th, 1969 which is the day Tate was murdered by members of the Manson family. Anyone seeing this movie and not knowing that will likely be confused.The running story involves two fictional characters, Leonardo DiCaprio as somewhat famous TV Western actor Rick Dalton, and his old pal, almost like a brother, Brad Pitt as Dalton's stunt double, Cliff Booth, who also happens to be well-trained and well-equipped as an accomplished fighter. Dalton' career is on the decline, he is afraid he is on the verge of has-been, so he goes to Italy to make several spaghetti westerns.Cliff is getting less and less work, but doesn't appear to worry about it at all, happy to live frugally with his dog in a small trailer behind the seedy drive-in theater. He remains loyal to his friendship with Rick.Margot Robbie is the only other I will mention, she is good as Sharon Tate who, with her husband Roman Polanski, lives next door to Dalton. In his movie ""Inglourious Basterds"" Tarantino writes a completely different story of Hitler in WW2, suffice to say his writing of the fate of Sharon Tate for this movie also departs significantly from history. Sort of a ""what if things had happened differently?""The only complaint I have is that so much of the dialog is filled with filthy language, not just an occasional F-bomb here and there but FILLED with it. That is Tarantino's style, I think he does it too much, but it is his movie. Even with that I find this to be an excellent and entertaining movie, deserving of its accolades. I watched it twice before I returned the BD to the library, the second viewing was as entertaining as the first.The extras on the disc are interesting also.",positive
"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood was an amazing trip for baby-boomers - taking us back to when television was loaded with westerns and western TV stars, cigarette commercials, big cars, white go-go boots, and names bandied around some of us haven't heard in years. And the shows: Hootnanny, Mannix, the FBI.And it's great to see some Hollywood celebrities -Mama Cass (Rachel Redleaf), Michelle Phillips (Rebecca Rittenhouse), Steve McQueen (Damien Lewis), James Stacy (Timothy Olyphant), Wayne Maunder (Luke Perry), Bruce Lee (Mike Moh), Connie Stevens (Dreama Walker).It was not so great given their fates, but there were some other familiar names too: Jay Sebring, (Emile Hirsch), Abigail Folger (Samantha Robinson), Voytek Frykowski (Costa Ronin), and Squeaky Fromme (Dakota Fanning).Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt star as series actor Rick Dalton and his stunt double, Cliff Booth. Booth isn't living the LA high life - far from it - and does part-time stunt work these days and basically acts as Rick's gofer.Rick lives, as it turns out, on Cielo Drive, right next Sharon Tate (Margo Robbie) and Roman Polanski (Rafal Zawierucha).Tarantino has the Manson story down pat - Manson coming to look for Terry Melcher, Doris Day's son, because a proposed record deal never materialized. Sharon's pregnancy, weekend guests, the visit to El Coyote, even sitting at the right table (I've been there hundreds of times), and it did look like they actually filmed inside.It was also fun to see Musso & Frank's Grill.Rick Dalton, whose career is losing ground due to his alcoholism, makes an appearance on ""Lancer,"" directed by Sam Waterston (Nicholas Hammond). Wanamaker, the original George in Virginia Woolf, did indeed do a lot of television directing.Rick's time on Lancer is juxtaposed with Sharon going to see herself in a film, The Wrecking Crew. We see her young, beautiful, and happy.I admit here that I felt the ""Lancer"" section was way too long, but part of that could be because I wasn't feeling that well during that time. It did show Rick determined to do a good job. The entire scene represents a wonderful tour de force for DiCaprio.After a nostalgic and sometimes amusing wind-up, Tarantino goes into full Tarantino mode in the last forty minutes or so. Also stay through the credits; the movie doesn't end where you think it does.So Tarantino in a way heals this beloved era and a time in Hollywood where everything was beginning to be in flux - western stars making films in Italy and Spain, the detective show taking the place of westerns, and events in the air that would change Hollywood forever.Pitt and DiCaprio are dynamite together, DiCaprio, drunk, sad, but a man who can still act. Pitt is cool and takes life as it comes.Another standout for me was Damien Lewis as Steve McQueen. The man's amazing.However, the film is loaded with vignettes and memories in the corners of our minds as the song says, that if you're a boomer, you can't not love. It was the summer of love, it was a prelude to a much more somber time. For the non-boomers, there are DiCaprio and Pitt doing what they do best - being movie stars.",positive
"Anyone who's very familiar with Quentin Tarantino knows he doesn't make conventional movies. So when watching his meandering narrative here, I just sat back and enjoyed his going wherever he feels he needs to go wherever it might lead us. Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio play a stunt man and an actor, respectively, in the late '60s in Hollywood who get mixed with some real-life people resulting in an alternate timeline. I'll stop there and just say me and my movie theatre-working friend enjoyed this (though he thought it was pretty weird) and I certainly enjoyed both Tarantino's dialogue and climatic action scenes. Really fascinating to watch to on that note, I recommend Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood.",positive
"I can't deny it ... I'm an avid Quentin Tarantino admirer, and I will probably always remain an avid Quentin Tarantino admirer. The man simply is a genius when it comes down to writing dazzling dialogues, getting the most out of stellar ensemble casts and depicting extreme but delirious violence. QT also always was the only director of whom I tolerated exaggeratedly long movies. ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Kill Bill"", ""Inglorious Bastards"", etc, it never bothered me that they lasted two and a half hours. But since, say, ""Django Unchained"", I'm noticing an increasingly worrying trend when I watch his newest movies. They are getting too long and far too tedious. They are generally still fine films, but when re-watching, I find myself fast-forwarding the overlong dialogues and only focusing on the violent parts. In case of ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"", I'm afraid I'll be skipping the full first two hours!It's interesting to watch once, perhaps, but the fan-boy fantasy tale of ""Hollywood in the Sixties"" that Tarantino penned down is honestly quite dull, repetitive and substantially void. It's literally just endlessly long sequences of Leonardi DiCaprio (a washed-up TV-western idol from the 50s) rehearsing his lines for a new show, Brad Pitt (an unemployed stunt double) feeding his dog and cruising around LA to pick up young hippie girls, and Margot Robbie (as Sharon Tate) parading around town and looking at herself on the big screen. You probably read it before in other reviews, but it's a sad truth: absolutely nothing interesting happens, and some sequences - notably when Brad Pitt ""trespasses"" into the hippie trailer park - are even downright pathetic. The last forty minutes are fabulous, though. You may regain consciousness as soon as you see the message ""6 months later"" appear on the screen. As an enormous fan of Italian exploitation of the sixties & seventies, I really adored how Tarantino sent DiCaprio's actor character to Rome and star in exhilarating trash titles like ""Nebraska Jim"", ""Shoot Ringo, said the Gringo"" or ""Operazione Dyn-O-Mite!"". When returning to their home in the Hollywood Hills, they are confronted with members of the notorious Manson Family that are out to kill Sharon Tate and her friends, but Quentin Tarantino gives history a sort of absurdly cool twist. The climax isn't so surprising or innovative if you have seen ""Inglourious Bastards"", but at least it finally provides the movie with what I had desperately been anticipating for more than two hours: sick, extreme and unhinged violence!",positive
"Out of all the Quentin Tarantino films, I like this one the best. This film is the most easily accessible, perhaps because of the pop culture references. Leonardo's acting is great, and he makes a great team with Brad. Another thing I like is the fact that it's not all about killing, but there's a really touching friendship between Leonardo and Brad. I enjoyed it a lot.",positive
"What could of; what should of; not everyone is going to find this Quentin Taranti no flick to their liking...nor to their understanding. But entertaining, you betcha'. Actor Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) , once a household name TV western star, is having trouble with his life after his six year TV ended. Fame and fortune is waning. His stunt double, Cliff (Brad Pitt), is as every by Rick's side , both trying to reinvent themselves as Hollywood's Golden Age in 1969 Los Angeles is dying. Then all hell breaks loose at neighbor Sharon Tate's (Margo Robbie) house.This comedy, drama gets a little long in the tooth, clocking in at 2 hrs 41 minutes. Also appearing, even for a brief time, are Al Pacino, Bruce Dern, Luke Perry, Kurt Russell, Dakota Fanning, Clu Gulager, Michael Madsen, Rumer Willis and Austin Butler.Exceptional soundtrack features the likes of: Deep Purple, Simon & Garfunkel, Joe Cocker, Bob Seeger, Roy Head and Paul Revere & The Raiders.",positive
"Sometimes I am shocked when I see a great film...only to see it has an incredibly low overall score on IMDB. This is definitely the case with ""Knives Out""....a great film by writer/director Rian Johnson that I strongly recommend you see. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if this one receives some Oscar nominations...it's that good.""Knives Out"" is like an Agatha Christie novel set in modern day America and with American characters. But it's not just a homage to Christie-style films but a genuinely good and unique film in its own right. Kudos to many of the actors...particularly Daniel Craig. I thought Craig was miscast as a Southern American detective....but he carried it off wonderfully.Overall, I have no complaints...nothing I disliked or would do differently. In fact, it was so good I nearly gave it a 10....and I completely enjoyed the movie.",positive
"It was very hard to say no to watching 'Knives Out' and it was one of my most anticipated films since it came out. It was due to being busy and personal problems that stopped me from seeing it sooner. A lot drew me in to watching it. Absolutely love murder mysteries and seeing a lot of comparisons to one of my favourite authors Agatha Christie and the starry cast were reasons enough for me to see it, as well as the great reviews.Found myself really enjoying, if not quite loving, 'Knives Out'. Can understand why it may not be for all, if one doesn't like seeing and hearing the truth much earlier on than they would expect, and it is easy to see the ridiculing for Daniel Craig's Southern accent (which is admittedly atrocious). Can totally understand its appeal and why it was so positively received though, because to me it was a well made, well acted and cleverly written film that shows that director Rian Johnson does have a great film in him. While not perfect or one of the best films ever made (though was not expecting 'The Godfather' or 'Casablanca' etc), it is a long way from being a 1/10 film, putting it down there with most of the films riffed on MST3K, films from SyFy and the Asylum, 'Home Alone 4', 'NeverEnding Story 3', 'Titanic: The Animated Movie' and the Baby Geniuses films is insulting. As far as 2019 goes, it is towards being one of the better films of that year if not one of the very best.'Knives Out' had potential to be even better than it was. If it didn't overdo or repeat too much the vomiting running gag and slowed the final solution down (a suitably complicated one that is explained a little too fast for my liking) it would have been a better film.Wouldn't have said no to the truth (well some of it was) being revealed later than it was, though even when it was placed when it was it was still in the final solution not at all what things initially seemed. The film is a little overlong as well.However, so much works here. 'Knives Out' looks great, full of atmospheric colour, beautiful locations (the interiors of the house are especially atmospheric), stylishly photographed and slickly edited. Nathan Johnson's score has menace and energy, without feeling overused or over-scored. Johnson directs expertly with a clear love for the genre being sent up.It is a cleverly scripted film too, shining especially in the smart and affectionate 70s murder mystery throwbacks and deliciously salty one liners and insults from Ransom. The story never felt dull to me and even when things seemed obvious too early some ingenious unexpected twists are brought in. Can totally see how Johnson was so influenced by Christie's writing, evidenced from as early on as the terrific opening sequence and with Christopher Plummer's patriarch character (a type of character seen frequently in Christie's books). A fine example of how to bring freshness to a very familiar genre often visited, while the final solution is incredibly clever though demands full attention.Moreover, the ensemble cast, one of the best from that year, clearly have a ball. There is some delicious deadpan but also some inspired but not overdone scenery-chewing. Accent aside, Craig does a great job breaking away from his Bond image and revels being comedic in a laconic way. Plummer (RIP) is perfectly cast and while his screen time is not large he makes the absolute most of it. Ana De Armas has one of the most difficult roles and shows no signs of being taxed. Jamie Lee Curtis, Toni Collette, Don Johnson and Michael Shannon all give it everything they've got. My favourite performance came from Evans, also breaking away from typecasting, he was never this witty or salty.Overall, very, very good. 8/10",positive
"KNIVES OUT is another comedy blockbuster based on the classic 'old dark house' style murder mystery plot that was once popular in the 1930s. The last time we had a wave of such movies was in the '80s, when the likes of CLUE was doing the rounds. This is a fairly amiable and enjoyable example of the genre, graced with a large ensemble cast each striving to out-perform one another, a fast pace and never a slow moment. Inevitably the plot itself feels quite artificial at times and stretches credulity on more than one occasion, but at least there are enough likeable or amusing characters and enough genuine surprises to keep you involved in what's going on. As for Daniel Craig, I have a suspicion that this is an easy kind of performance in a role that could be played by any actor, but he's funny enough in the part.",positive
"Wealthy murder mystery novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) is dead from a presumed suicide. The investigating police is joined by dapper private detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) who was hired by an unknown person. It's a family of annoying backbiting leeches and Harlan's kindly nurse Marta Cabrera (Ana de Armas) who cannot lie without vomiting.Quite frankly, the movie is a fifty-fifty proposition for the first half. The family is so annoying and Daniel Craig is trying so hard to act. I really need him to stop his accent work. His character would be perfectly great with a British accent. It's all far too peculiar as Rian Johnson is doing his Brick work. The movie reveals the death early on and it seemed obviously from the very beginning that it boils down to the tox screen. She's on the hook as soon as that reveals her mistake. Non of it can cover that up. It becomes a lot of running around in circles.Then something happens that hooks me into the movie. I started rooting for her to escape Blanc's questioning. The vomiting starts as a silly gimmick at first but ends up helping build a good amount of tension. The last incident is obvious even before it starts but it's still fun. The tox screen is the flashing warning sign throughout the early parts even if it's never mentioned. I kept waiting. When it finally shows up as a major plot point, it seems problematic since there are bound to be copies. Chris Evans adds a great energy in the second half. Despite the nagging questions, it becomes a fun rollercoaster ride. It's a lot of ups and downs but it's never in doubt that it will roll safely to an exit. One thing that bugs me more than most. I don't know what Fran assumes about Ransom's scheme. She sees him tampering with the drugs but she steals the bag. What's the point of that? She steals a copy of the report but the original is bound to come out. What's the point of that? She blackmails him and meets him alone in an empty laundromat. What's the point of that? I don't think Fran's actions make any sense and is nothing more than a series of necessary moves for plot advancement which can all be excuse with Blanc saying that she doesn't even know what's happening. I have come to see Rian Johnson as a filmmaker with interesting style but sometimes his convoluted stories do not favor deeper examinations. Overall, I really got into this movie despite whatever nagging reservations I had about the plot.",positive
"No, it wasn't perfect. No it was not Academy Award material. But it was a delightful story with lots of classic whodunnit elements. I thought we got to know each character well and, like in an Agatha Christie novel, fulfilled their roles. I thought Craig did a nice job and kept things moving along. Plummer was good in his limited screen time. Once again, I'm so fed up with people who decide that IMDB presents an opportunity to destroy a valid system by giving a movie such as this a rating of One. Do you really think this film ranks down there with Alligator Women on Venus. That's what the One ratings are for. It's usually because a film gets a little hype and those with no imagination or who are unhappy with their lives feel the need to throw everything off. Use lower ratings, but try to show some objectivity.",positive
"The mystery writer Christopher Plummer has died. Although the police have just about wrapped up their investigation, his nurse, Ana de Armas is nervous; she knows that she had given him the wrong doses of medicine, the antidote was missing from her bag, and he had slashed his throat after arranging with her an elaborate charade so she would would not be suspected. The family and police were satisfied, yet here is the great detective Daniel Craig, holding it open. He has been hired to investigate, although he does not know by whom. The plot thickens when the will is read, and the heir to Plummer's vast fortune is Miss de Armas.Once upon a time, the movie theaters ran full programs of selected short subjects, a feature film, and quite often a second feature. The second features were generally lower-budgeted movies, meant to be rented out to the theaters at a flat rate, and often genre films.... like mystery films. Some of these second features were series, and quite popular; it was no unknown for people to go to a show specifically for the second feature, a Sherlock Holmes mystery, or a Charlie Chan mystery, featuring stars who perhaps did not shine brightly enough for the major studios' A pictures, but would bring in the customers.Eventually, the program shortened: no more selected short subjects, no more second feature. Nowadays, a movie show usually consists of a feature film and previews of coming attractions. Yet, long as it is, and with such a varied and interesting cast as it has -- Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Don Johnson, and half a dozen others -- this movie strikes me as a B picture, with an ornate plot, some small and gratifying witticisms.... in short, a superior example of the form.If you are wise enough to see this movie, you will be sorely confused, as mystery is piled atop mystery, and how to untangle them all. I know I was. At the end, all will be revealed, and the journey from start to finish will have turned out to be worthwhile.",positive
"Knives Out is an American mostly English-language movie from 2019 that made it now in 2020 also here to Germany. The writer and director is Rian Johnson and I am a bit unsure about him honestly. His very first film ""Brick"" I was not big on at all, maybe because also the lead role seemed miscast, but some of his other career works I enjoy a lot and that includes of course also his television work on the marvellous Breaking Bad. But now he is safe on the big screen. Seems a very versatile guy anyway, not too long ago he directed a pretty nice music video for LCD Soundsystem. Anyway, for this film here that runs for slightly over 2 hours, so not a short watch at all, he received his very first Oscar nomination this morning and a huge success for him and after seeing the film now, it is not undeserving at all. The movie also achieved nice accolades at all kinds of other award shows, such as Golden Globe nominations for Daniel Craig and Ana de Armas. For Craig it was the first believe it or not and even if I like him there's no way I can say that Ana de Armas is not the film's brightest spot and I would have liked her to get an Oscar nomination as well. Oh well, maybe at some point in the future. As for the other cast members, you will find many big names here. They are all supporting and I guess it comes down to how much you like them when deciding who's your favorite because they all do not have the biggest impact on the story, but are nice to watch. I personally enjoyed Shannon the most, which is not a surprise because that is true for almost every film he is in. Really versatile actor. Don Johnson I found most forgettable perhaps, but this was also expected as I don't have much connection with him in other films and the revelation about his character being unfaithful also added very little for me, even if the way how his wife found out was kinda funny. Christopher Plummer can of course also always be relied on and it's so nice to see that even close to the age of 90, he is still dellivering quality portrayals that are pretty much flawless. Luckily, even if his character is killed right at the beginning of the film, the man gets a lot of screen time as we get closer to finding out what actually happened.So it is a crime story and Johnson took an interesting path here. He gave us the detailed solution who did it and what exactly happened already before half of the film is over. But this is also only half the truth as we find out at the end. I do not really want to go too much into detail about the ending and how everything unfolds because you should experience that yourself. I just felt somehow that they all did it maybe (they all planned it), but then it was just one bad guy, but he was really very bad as we see when he grabs that knife and unlucky for him, it was just an artificial knife this time, which really (also with the slow motion scene leading to it) was absolutely hilarious and I and almost everybody else in the theatre was laughing so hard. Brilliant reference at that point back to the film's beginning when we have Chris Plummer's character (I think it was him) say something about how knives are sometimes real and sometimes just imitations. Luckily, that one was an imitation because it would have been heartbreaking if the guy really could have killed de Armas' character. She is also pretty stunning no denying. But so is Katherine Langford.Anyway, let's not get carried away on looks now, or at least not human looks. That knife throne already made for a nice smile on my lips with how Craig sits in it and all the knives are pointing at him. Really nice and smart and creative inclusion of the murder/suicide weapon. As for the Armas, her character is really depicted in such an innocent manner in the sense of how she is really the ultimately good human being. That made her truly memorable with how things played out at the end. Still in-between, I cannot deny that I thought maybe actually she was not that nice and in fact an evil mastermind, like when she immediately said that it was Hemsworth's character who wanted her to drive and put the blame on him. But it was nothing. Still, clearly Johnson was toying with the idea that we in the audience could think she murdered the old man on purpose knowing she was the one who'd get it all. Very talented actress, she delivered her part too and also nailed her funnier moments, which admittedly also had a lot to do with the script like when she tells Shannon's character that it is perfect because she has the money to get great lawyers or of course in another epic moment when the film closes exactly the way it started, with a cup that has some pretty memorable words on it that will again have you in stitches.I mean it is not a perfect mvoie, but there really isn't too much wrong. Maybe I struggled with believing that Craig's character actually knew it all so quickly because of the blood spot and also the exact revelation came totally out of nowhere at the end and he must be a true mastermind that he figured it all out so effortlessly apparently. But as a huge Bond fan, I cannot really say anything negative at all about his character. Or about the actor. He made some great career choices in terms of which films he played in in recent years and knowing the upcoming is his last appearance as 007, I am not only genuinely curious about this one, but also about all other projects he will work on in the future. I think there may be some great things in store. Perhaps he can even collaborate with Johnson again and give us a sequel/prequel here that is about how he solved the tennis player case that is mentioned on one occasion in this movie by another character. By the way, the Black policeman was really forgettable here, the other White officer though brought in some nice comedy with how much he was in awe of the creative people around him, especially at the end when he shushes his colleague down. Have to mention the Cluedo quote as well.Okay, let me think what else can I say about this film. It is a pretty long one yes, but it was so interesting and entertaining that it really flew by. There is great attention to detail here on so many occasions. One excellent example is how the female protagonist was really good enough in her profession that she took the right medicine because she saw the difference in color, which really made me appreciate de Armas' character even more. Okay the story with the other woman blackmailing the killer I could have done without probably, but even these more mediocre scenes and moments only fade because everything else constructed around them is so awesome. They are still okay by general standards and even these include moments of true creativity, such as the reference about ""you"" not being ""Hugh"" and how only staff calls him that. So no matter which perspective you take, it is difficult to find any real reasons why this film should get a thumbs-down. The good in here is just so much more frequent and permanent than the weak, which is pretty much not existent anyway.Oh yeah, I really shall not forget about the super old lady there: She does not even need to say a word to make for comedic gold, be it early on when we find out nobody knows how old she really is (from Collette) or later on when she sits there right in front of the window and sees de Armas' character (also pay attention how nobody can remember which country she is from originally and how they wanted her to be at the funeral, but more people were against it) or when she sits with Craig's character later on. Okay maybe she would have been more interesting if she actually did not know what was going on around her instead of telling Craig's character and the explanation about what she said in detail and that it explained how Hemsworth's character returned before that already also did not really convince me, but I am glad she was included nonetheless. This was maybe my favorite comedy film from 2019, despite the serious undertone and crime(s) happening, because I kinda struggle with seeing Tarantino's new film as a comedy, even if that one was as good as this one here, or maybe even slightly inferior. Okay, that is all then. Of course I give ""Knives Out"" a (very) positive recommendation and it is for sure among the most astounding cinematic achievements from the last 52 weeks. Highly recommended and please please make another movie about Benoit Blanc.",positive
"When the millionaire writer Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) is found dead at home, the police investigate his apparent suicide together with the famous private investigator Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig), who was mysteriously hired by someone interested in finding if Harlan was killed. They interview the dysfunctional family members and the servants that lived or worked with Harlan in his mansion but when his testament is opened, the investigation presents twists and surprises.""Knives Out"" is an entertaining but overrated film in the style of Agatha Christie. Benoit Blanc is a kind of Sherlock Holmes and the cast is excellent. The screenplay begins without any character development and the viewer learns the characters along the investigation. Consequently the beginning is a little boring. But it is worthwhile watching this film without expecting the hype around. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Entre Facas e Segredos"" (""Between Knives and Secrets"")",positive
"Knives Out is a star studded whodunit where all the suspects are gathered in the mansion.It is a knowing variation of the board game Cluedo which itself was turned into a movie in the mid 1980s. The victim is best selling crime novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer.)A private detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) has been hired to find out if the writer's death really was murder or as the police suspect, a suicide. A recently changed will might lead to a motive.This comedy mystery is reliant on Harlan's personal nurse Marta (Ana de Armas) a woman who physically throws up if she tells a lie.Following the conventions of many Agatha Christie mysteries, Knives Out turns a lot of the essential ingredients of the genre in his head by adding several layers to the story.However it is not original as there have been several movies that have twisted the crime mystery genre. It also feel slightly laboured and in the end it is superficial as Craig's accent which at times becomes grating.Chris Evans playboy character is underwritten and he struggles amongst other cast members such as Don Johnson, Michael Shannon and Jamie Leigh Curtis.",negative
"I'm not a regular at the cinema any more - at one point I'd go weekly, whereas now it is probably once a year at most; last year it was 'Knives Out' that got me there, and I was glad to have watched it in that setting because at home distracted by tasks, requests, and children, probably the film would not have worked quite as well as it did. In the cinema though, with nothing to be a barrier to the film, it was easy to get into its tone and very much go with it. The reward is an enjoyable and satisfying mystery. I do like these type of films, but too often I find myself either many steps behind the detectives, or just having to accept their sudden reveals because I can't keep up enough to understand where all the twists came from. With this film though the mystery is welcoming and engaging, bringing you inside it from the start, and having twists that surprise and reveal, but yet make sense within the context of the film.Within this there is plenty to like. There is a playfulness to the delivery that is regularly funny and enjoyable. It also gives space for a nice slice of ham here and there from the cast. The social commentary is there too, in the way it handles immigrants, or the way the rich try to convince the poor that the former only have the latter's interests in mind. All of these things add to the film, but importantly they do not detract in any way - ie it is never silly, clumsy, or 'woke' but rather the mystery remains the focus throughout. The very talented cast make the most of the material, and the whole production looks great and has very stylish framing and direction. The result is a very entertaining murder mystery that delivers within that genre, while also having plenty more to recommend it for.",positive
"The whodunit seemed to be a dead genre, confined to the 60's and 70's, but with Knives out, and Death on the Nile set for November, maybe there is still some interest left.This is a seriously stylish, well crafted and all around awesome movie, huge credit to the writer for coming up with a plot that was relevant for present day, and which was quite brilliant. Plenty of twists, turns and red herrings, it's a smashing mix of drama and humour.Terrific acting from the ensemble cast, Daniel Craig, Toni Colette, Jamie Lee Curtis all wonderful, Chris Evans was awesome.It has been a success, it'll be interesting to see if it does reawaken the whodunit genre.9/10",positive
"Knives Out reminded me of ""Gosford Park"", with its focus on an obnoxious rich family amid a murder. In both cases, there are things that we find out about the family. In this case, Rian Johnson's Oscar-nominated screenplay really lets the characters unleash their most wanton statements. Like the miniseries ""The Politician"", it shows what people end up doing when they have unlimited wealth.Definitely see it. You're in for some real surprises.",positive
"We all love a good whodunit, the most famous sleuths like Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple deducing a murderer from an A-list cast of suspects, well, now comes this modern day movie in the same league, written and directed by Rian Johnson (Brick Lane, Looper, Star Wars: Episode VII - The Last Jedi). Basically, wealthy crime novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) is celebrating his 85th birthday and invites his family to his mansion for his party. The next morning, Harlan's housekeeper Fran (Edi Patterson) finds him dead, apparently having slit his own throat. An anonymous figure hires private detective Benoit Blanc (Golden Globe nominated Daniel Craig) to investigate. Blanc learns that Harlan had alienated many of the family: he had threatened to expose his son-in-law Richard Drysdale (Don Johnson) for having an affair; cut off the allowance of his daughter-in-law Joni (Toni Collette) for stealing money, meant for the tuition for his granddaughter Megan ""Meg"" (Katherine Langford); fired his youngest son Walter ""Walt"" (Michael Shannon) from his publishing company; and cut his lazy grandson Ransom (Chris Evans) out of his will. Flashbacks reveal that after the party Harlan's nurse Marta Cabrera (Golden Globe nominated Ana de Armas) accidentally injected Harlan with a fatal dose of morphine. Minutes from death, Harlan told Marta how to avoid suspicion, making it appear he was still alive after she had driven home, then he slit his own throat. Because Marta cannot lie without vomiting, she avoids answering the questions of Detective Lieutenant Elliot (LaKeith Stanfield), but Blanc asks her to assist in his investigation. As they search the property, Marta attempts to conceal evidence, but is only partially successful. The family, including Harlan's eldest daughter Linda (Jamie Lee Curtis), is shocked to hear from Harlan's lawyer Alan Stevens (Frank Oz) that Harlan left everything to Marta. They turn on her, but Ransom helps her escape. Ransom tricks Marta into confessing to him but offers to help her in exchange for his share of the inheritance. The other Thrombeys realize that, under the slayer rule, Marta will lose the inheritance if she killed Harlan, but Blanc tells them that they all are still suspects. They try to persuade Marta to renounce her inheritance. Marta receives a blackmail note with a partial photocopy of Harlan's toxicology report. She and Ransom drive to the medical examiner's office, but it has been destroyed in a fire. Marta receives an email with a time and address to meet the blackmailer. Blanc spots her and Ransom, the police catch and arrest Random, while Blanc tells Marta that Wanetta ""Great Nana"" Thrombey (K Callan), Harlan's mother, saw Ransom climbing down from Harlan's upstairs rooms on the night of his death. Marta goes to the address in the email and discovers Fran drugged. Marta confesses everything to Blanc, but Ransom has already informed on her. At the house, Marta finds Fran had the copy of the full toxicology report. Marta is about to confess everything to the family, but Blanc stops after finding something missing in the report. He brings Marta, Ransom and the police to a room to reveal his deductions. Ransom learned that Harlan was leaving everything to Marta, so he swapped the contents of Marta's medication vials so she would kill Harlan with an overdose, so she would not gain the inheritance. However, Marta, an experienced nurse, administered the correct medicine without reading the labels. After the death was reported as suicide, Ransom anonymously hired Blanc to discover Marta's guilt. Fran later witnesses Ransom swapping the vials back and sent him the blackmail note. Realising that Marta had given Harlan the correct medication, Ransom passed on the blackmail note to Marta, removing the address and time. He burned down the medical examiner's office to destroy the evidence of Marta's innocence and burned Fran's copy of the toxicology report. He drugged Fran with morphine and emailed her location to Marta, planning to frame Marta for Fran's murder. Marta receives a call from the hospital and says that Fran is alive. Believing that Fran will implicate him, Ransom angrily confesses, and vows revenge. Marta vomits on Ransom; she lied that Fran had survived, and tricked Ransom into confessing. In anger, he grabs a knife from the wall to attack and kill her, but discovers it is a retractable stage knife. Ransom is taken into custody, while Marta watches him and the Thrombey family members from the balcony of what is now her mansion. Also starring Jaeden Martell as Jacob Thrombey, Noah Segan as Trooper Wagner, Riki Lindhome as Donna Thrombey, M. Emmet Walsh as Mr. Proofroc, Marlene Forte as Mrs. Cabrera and Shyrley Rodriguez as Alicia Cabrera, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt has a voice cameo as Detective Hardrock. Craig is likeably comical as the detective from the Deep South (he sounds like Foghorn Leghorn lol), and other cast members like Curtis, Collette and Armas look like they are having a blast, Evans get some of the best lines throwing insults. The whodunit is a well-trodden genre, but with the addition of a witty script and some deadpan humour along the way, this is a terrific refreshing take on it, I admit you have to really concentrate to get the concluding twist, but I'd like to see a follow-up, overall an entertaining murder mystery. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for Rian Johnson, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. Very good!",positive
"After giving us the godawful Star Wars movie The Last Jedi, I was ready to get my knives out for anything directed by Rian Johnson, but I was pleasantly surprised by this engrossing, star-studded whodunit. While its twists aren't always unpredictable, the film is still a whole lot of Agatha Christie-style fun, as private detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) tries to unravel the mystery behind the death of wealthy novelist Harlan Thrombey, with numerous suspects among his family and staff.Is Harlan's Guatamalan caregiver Marta (Ana de Armas) responsible for her boss's death as she believes, or is someone else guilty? As the plot unfolds, one becomes convinced that Marta is simply a pawn, but quite who is making all the moves remains unclear until the very end, when all the pieces are finally put together by Blanc. It's an enjoyable ride, and there's more fun to be had after the film has finished in trying to remember all the plot twists and see if they check out. I'm satisfied that they do.With such a great cast (Jamie Lee Curtis, Toni Colette, Don Johnson, Chris Evans, Michael Shannon), the performances are solid, and everyone looks like they're having a whale of a time with the old-style murder/mystery shenanigans. If you push all thoughts of The Last Jedi out of your mind (a big ask, I grant you), there's a good chance you'll have a good time too.7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",positive
"My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our local library. We enjoyed it but I have a hard time sharing all the high praise for this movie. It is one where near the end lots and lots of exposition is required to explain what all happened and how the inspector figured things out. To me that is a flaw in the script and directing.The most curious character is Daniel Craig playing a deep south (think thick Georgia accent) detective Benoit Blanc. He is called in by the family after their very wealthy partiarc is found dead, seemingly of suicide. But there's a lot going on in this eccentric extended family and when the will is read all hell breaks loose.The movie is mostly entertaining but the first part, where the detective and local police interview each person, moves a bit slowly. The fine ensemble cast is the main reason to watch this, otherwise there really isn't anything other movies haven't already covered.",positive
"Daniel Craig does his best imitation of Foghorn Leghorn as a detective in ""Knives Out,"" from 2020. Craig plays Benoit Blanc, brought it by an anonymous client to investigate the death of author-millionaire Harlan Thrombey. It's been called a suicide, but slitting one's throat is an odd way of ending your life.Blanc finds himself dealing with the dysfunctional family; Harlan's daughter (Curtis), her husband (Johnson), Greatnana Wanetta (K Callan), and assorted other Thrombeys, plus Harlan's assistant (de Armas).When Harlan's will is read, all hell breaks loose.There's not too much more to say - you'll have to see this delightful Agatha Christie-like confection through to the twists and final end. Very enjoyable.",positive
"So me and Mom finally watched this movie a few weeks after I found it on Amazon Prime Video. It's a pretty fun mystery with Daniel Craig as the investigating detective, Chris Evans as one of the family suspects, and Ana de Armas as the domestic who helps guide Craig in the solving. Oh, and I also liked Christopher Plummer as the family patriarch. So on that note, Mom and I highly recommend Knives Out.",positive
"Rian Johnson has jumped genres throughout his career - the noir Brick, the comedy of The Brothers Bloom, the science fiction of Looper, the big blockbuster that was Star Wars: the Last Jedi and now Knives Out. He also helmed an episode of Breaking Bad that won him a directing Emmy.Since 2005, Johnson has had this Agatha Christie-influenced film in mind. He also cited films like Deathtrap and Clue as cultural touchstones for this movie.So what's it all about? Well, crime novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) is found dead - a suicide - at his estate the day after his 85th birthday. Detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) has been hired by an unnamed party to investigate the crime. From Harlan's dysfunctional family to his devoted staff, Blanc sifts through a web of red herrings and self-serving lies to uncover the truth behind Harlan's untimely death.First things first: my attention span has been ruined by a steady diet of grindhouse movies, Hong Kong cinema and the works of Italian gorehounds. A movie over two hours long is quite intimidating to me, but I did my best to stick with it.So the good things: Daniel Craig is absolutely having the time of his life playing private detective Benoit Blanc and every scene with him is a joy to watch. I really enjoyed the twists and turns of the plot, as well as the detection flashbacks, which brought to mind the original Murder on the Orient Express. And it's always great to see Plummer in a movie, as he was, after all the emperor of the galaxy in Starcrash. Yes, that's my cultural callback for this venerated actor.This movie is a chance for Chris Evans to break out of the superhero mold he's found himself in. And Ana de Armas - who is also in the Eli Roth film Knock Knock - is great as Marta Cabrera, the nurse who finds herself inheriting the estate of the murdered writer who is the patriarch of this family of liars and thieves at the heart of this story.Hey - there's M. Emmet Walsh, filling in for Ricky Jay who died during production. And Riki Lindhome from Garfunkle and Oates and the remake of The Last House on the Left (and also Under the Silver Lake). Plus, it's cool to see Frank Oz in his first onscreen role since, well, Blues Brothers 2000.But man - there are so many characters here that have little or no time to shine. Jamie Lee Curtis is basically playing a cameo role and you could say the same thing for Toni Colette, Michael Shannon and Don Johnson.When we reached the one hour point, my wife asked me, ""How much longer does this have?"" I told her that we weren't even halfway done yet and she replied, ""What else do they have to tell us?""I liked the film more than her. Despite reading reviews filled with hyperbole saying things about how this movie has reinvented the murder mystery and turned it on its head, I thought it was a pleasant enough diversion. It's not going to replace Agatha Christie movies for me, but for an audience that has probably never seen the films like Sleuth and Gosford Park that Johnson is inspired by, it's certainly a revelation for them.Your mileage, as I always say, may vary.",positive
"With the exception of my wife and daughter, and possibly my mother, Agatha Christie is the woman whom I love most on this planet. She truly was the most gifted and brilliant fiction writer who ever lived, and it rejoices me to see that her work still inspires other writers and filmmakers nowadays; more than forty years after she passed away. There are still many adaptations of her original work, but with ""Knives Out"", writer/director Rian Johnson attempts something entirely different. It's abundantly clear that Johnson was inspired by all of Christie's typical trademarks and hobby-horses, and he pays tribute to her most legendary characters and favorite settings, but the plot of ""Knives Out"" is entirely new and scripted directly for the screen. A good old-fashioned murder mystery/whodunit set in the enormous mansion of a wealthy family, full of eccentric people each of whom have dirty little secrets, convoluted plot twists, continuous red herrings that practically make it impossible to guess along, and a fabulous all-knowing but slightly odd sleuth slowly unravelling the clues.Daniel Craig is downright terrific as Benoit Blanc, a private detective with a bizarre accent and weird one-liners, hired by someone anonymous to dig deeper into the strange and sudden death of patriarch Harlan Thrombey. It looks like suicide, but literally every greedy member of Harlan's bloodline had a motive for killing and - also in delightful Agatha Christie tradition - the plot even thickens after the reading of the will. It would be a shame to reveal too much about the plot, but rest assured that is refreshing and inventive, compelling as well as humorous, complex but simultaneously light-headed and 200% entertaining. The cast is phenomenal. Craig clearly enjoyed depicting a heroic protagonist that is the complete opposite of his James Bond character, and the Thrombey family exclusively exists of great talents, including Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Toni Colette, Christopher Plummer and Don Johnson. ""Knives Out"" is perhaps slightly too long, but never tedious, and very well-directed by Rian Johnson (who honestly doesn't deserve all this hatred from disappointed ""Star Wars"" geeks)",positive
"This film tells the investigation of a private detective who tries to solve the mystery of a very rich man's death.The stellar cast is already a joy to watch. Add the really suspenseful plot to the film, and you get a great bag of entertainment. I find the plot very suspenseful, and it really turns in a different direction every time you think you have it figured out. The production is very good as well. The scene of Daniel Craig smoking in the garden in the dark is very visually striking. I really enjoyed it!",positive

"A rich elderly writer (Christopher Plummer) commits suicide and his combative family (including Jamie Lee Curtis, Don Johnson and Chris Evans) line up to see who gets what. But was it really suicide...or murder? Detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) starts investigating.Good mystery. It's full of twists and turns and has some funny moments. Also there's some stunning production design--LOVE the house Plummer lives in. There's also a large great cast giving good performances. No one is bad but Craig, Curtis and Evans are excellent. Still I didn't love it. It's a little too long and gets needlessly convoluted at the end. Also a lot of the humor fell flat and some of these characters are really vicious. Still it's worth seeing at least once for the cast alone.",positive
"A pretty good movie; not quite the masterpiece that some would have you believe, it's too derivative for that, but it's still worth a watch and there's no denying that Joaquin Phoenix delivers an excellent performance in the title role. My main bone of contention with this film is that it really doesn't need to be tied up to the whole superhero genre, setting up the rivalry with Batman for at least half the running time; it's a better film than that and would have served better as a stand-alone psychological portrait of mental breakdown. Films this seems to have been inspired by include THE MECHANIC, THE KING OF COMEDY and of course TAXI DRIVER.",positive
"Gotham is in dire difficulties like New York City back in the 70's. Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is a mentally unstable clown. He laughs uncontrollably in stressful times. He gets beaten and robbed by a group of youths. He gets fired from his job. He lives with his unstable sick mom (Frances Conroy) who worked for Thomas Wayne and claims him to be her ex-lover and Arthur's biological father. When Arthur is attacked by three drunken suits in the subway, he shoots them dead. Thomas Wayne is outraged by the killing of these three well-educated pillars of society and announces his campaign for the mayor's office. Arthur has a relationship with his single-mom neighbor Sophie Dumond (Zazie Beetz) and admires talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro).This is great character work from Joaquin Phoenix. He is one of the great actors working today. Director Todd Phillips is pounding his chest a lot and deserves some praise. I do have a couple of problems with his work. The smaller problem is the continuous shooting of Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne with her pearls. That scene has been done so many times in the past three decades. It may be better to simply suggest it with a clown walking into the alley with a gun. Don't show the shooting. Just do the sound of the shot and leave. It's all been done before and Phillips should know this. The bigger issue is setting up this world. I think Phillips expected that the audience knows this world as a given. The streets have lots of garbage. There are news reports. Phillips fails to spell it out especially if income inequality is such a big theme in the movie. It needs a Wall Street protest or two. At least, there should be a protest in front of Wayne Tower. The first clown protest against Wayne seems to come out of nowhere. The hatred of the rich needs some background. Overall, this is a great new needed voice in the comic book superhero genre which presents ground to build a new franchise on.",positive
"In many aspects, it is a mirror. For society, for viewer, for the way of development of society. Its basic virtues - the splendid performance of Joaquin Phoenix and the beautiful cinematography. And, sure, the ignore of comic book character for feel the film not as portrait but as large cry. The sins - maybe too much ""Taxi Driver"" and the ambition to explain and show everything. The angry, the frustrations, the refuges, the falls of mind and soul are only suggested for be, in real sense, credible. Short, a form of manifesto. Or only a sort of mirror for each of its viewers.",negative
"In a crumbling Gotham City, where the government has simply given up, failed clown Joaquin Phoenix goes from loser to an acclaimed clown vigilante.This movie is about the creation and rise of Batman villain The Joker. It draws on the societal collapse of the 1970s and 1980s, with references to Bernie Goetz, Robert De Niro present to make the audience think of TAXI DRIVER and his failed and insane comic in THE KING OF COMEDY. It could have been a reference to lend a veneer of cinematic respectability to this movie. Comic books arose, lazily repurposing shards of popular culture for an audience too young to recognize them for what they were, during the depths of the Depression. It was a time that led people to believe that society was in inevitable collapse; large swaths of the 2019 audience believed the same. It could have been obvious and cheap, except for all the trash in the street and Phoenix's committed performance. As it is, with the 1980s standing in for society today, society in the 1930s... Batman is not even present, just his father (who might be Phoenix's father also; emphasizing the duality that keeps being imposed on the relationship), who, it is implied, could do something, but doesn't.... well, it's a thoroughly unlikable and well made movie. Just because I don't like the message, I don't insist on shooting the messenger, even though I've heard this message many times. So the implication is that it's been ignored, and will keep being repeated until attention is paid.If only it didn't glory in the dirt and destruction.",negative
"This is ""Joker"", a 2019 movie and the title is really telling what/who it is about. But first things first: The director is Todd Phillips and he is also one of several writers working on the screenplay for this 2-hour movie. Phillips is still mostly known for his Hangover films probably and in general for his collaborations with Zach Galifianakis. So gently-speaking, the filmmaker's career is not exactly filled with projects that were received greatly by critics. This one here is no exception either. General movie-goers apparently really loved it, but critics not so much. A bit like Bohemian Rhapsody not too long ago. That one I really adored though, this one here not so much. Still I am a big Joaquin Phoenix fan and as such, it is impossible to give the film a thumbs-down overall. He is the movie. And I am really glad he plays the title character because otherwise I maybe would not have liked it at all. Not just because of personal preference, but also because Phoenix really is that good from beginning to end and he is in almost every scene. Not too long ago, Jared Leto played the Joker (Batman's nemesis) and there was a lot of hype surrounding his turn that quickly vanished because he really did not have too much screen time at all and stayed pale in comparison to Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn. But let's not drift away from this film here now. For Phoenix, all the hype is justified and well-deserved. I think he is still up there and a potential contender for the Oscar win this year with his nomination pretty much a safe deal and I read that it could be between him and Adam Driver and I like both for being slightly oddball, so I certainly approve. Of course with stuff like Her, The Master and my personal favorite Walk the Line under his belt, it is arguable if this one here should be the movie for which he gets a golden statuette, but I still hope he does. If we consider Daniel Day-Lewis retired now, he is probably the best actor working right now and as he is still under 50, that is quite impressive. At least in my opinion, but he is just so consistent and constantly adds depth to his characters in a way where you feel nobody else could have done it this well. He does so much with his eyes. Okay you get the message, I thought he was an amazing Joker.Sadly I cannot say the same about the film itself really. There are good moments here and there, no denying at all, but I was still not satisfied with the script I must say. It felt to me that, most of all, they were taking the safe route basically and going the way where it would obviously be a crowd pleaser, but somehow I must say that the film felt zero daring to me. Even the interactions with the Wayne family that could easily really have been goosebump material, felt a bit shoddy and for the sake of it all. I did like, however, that the way things seemed to turn out we thought it would definitely be the Joker who kills Bruce's father in the end because of the personal connection, but it was just one of his ""army"" eventually and it does not matter who did it. Joker is not really getting his hands dirty at that point anymore, he has others who do so for him. Also pay attention to how everybody who means something to him early on (his mother, De Niro's character most of all) are killed by him. I must say I did wonder though how they did not try to catch him after he strangles his mother. I mean as for the colleague at his apartment, it made more sense because the time between that and the show appearance was perhaps too short. But still the cops were following him and that was accurate. There, however, Clownmania was already going on in full force you could say. Big enough though for police not to go to the studio and arrest him right away? I would say I disagree.In general, this is a film where you can never really be sure how much of it is real and how much just happens in the protagonist's head. Like his relationship with the neighbor, but that is just the obvious one where we know it is fake, even if I did not see it coming. Of course also the relationship between his mother and Mr. Wayne (okay that seemed fairly far-fetched from the beginning, I mean Joker cannot be Batman's half-brother can he?) or the medical condition he has in terms of laughing or the idea about De Niro's character early on almost acting like a father figure to him in front of the camera, which most likely was fake too because there were no references later on that it was not his first time on the show. So this is a film that will certainly play with your head continuously because the only moments you can be 100% sure they are real and actually happening are those that include a great deal of violence, such as the killing of the three young men on the subway. Or the talk show host murder. Or the killing of his mother? Or maybe is that fake too? I mean it is a big step, even if she did invent the relationship with Bruce's dad. He really really cares for her. And he won't kill the colleague who always treated him well. I thought it was a psycho trick that he left the door closed and the guy is too small to reach the knob/key, but no he really just forgot it and lets him go eventually. He is a psychopath yes, but with his very own unpredictable style. Of course, there are aside from that these moments with all the over-the-top laughing, most notably when he visits the comedy show and laughs each and every time everybody else stays quiet and stays quiet himself when they are laughing at the punch lines. Now that was kinda hilarious because of how awkward it felt and also very telling because we saw how he totally did not fit in with everybody else, the average people.Okay, I think this would be pretty much all then. I mentioned some of the scenes that stayed most memorable to me. Maybe, most likely, you have different scenes that fit the description for you and that is perfectly fine because there are so many to pick from. There is hardly one that is really weak and I think the running time was accurate too and I don't say that too often about 2-hour movies that they should not have kept it a bit shorter on some occasions, so you can see it as a compliment. But like I mentioned previously already, those scenes that did stand out mostly did so because of Phoenix giving it his best and not really because of great writing. I think the dialogue writing was still a bit better than the writing of the action and what the characters were doing compared to saying, which sometimes made me forgot about the relatively weak ways in which the story was progressing. This also applies especially to the idea of everybody getting more and more crazy out there somehow. There is a fairly memorable quote from Fleck (Joker in his ""human form"") about that that they really could have made a lot with (also they included it in the trailer) story-wise, but the way they included the clown army for example felt really out of nowhere and it did not make too much sense to me. Okay we get it. Gotham is not at a good place to be right now, but with such a movement you just have to come up with a better explanation and elaboration and lead us there more convincingly. Okay that would be all then I liked and disliked about this film. It certainly won't make it into my top10 movies of the year and if it gets in at the Oscars for Best Picture, that is too much I think, but I wish Phoenix all the luck he can have for upcoming awards season because his turn here can really be described as greatness. There was always a lot of arguing about who's the best Joker. Nicholson? Ledger? Hamill? Romero? There is definitely a new name that can be added to the discussion now. All in all, the film gets a thumbs-up from me.",positive
"In Gotham City, the clown and aspirant comedian Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is an outcast mentally disturbed man that lives with his deranged mother Penny Fleck (Frances Conroy). When the social service office that attends him is shutdown, Arthur stops his medication and the abusive society drives him crazier to a criminal life.""Joker"" is a dark and depressive film that discloses a dramatic version of the Joker´s origin. Joaquin Phoenix has a top-notch performance in the role of a mentally disturbed man disregarded by the society with a nervous twitch. His acting makes the viewer recalls and compares with Heath Ledger in ""The Dark Knight"", the best so far.

"What kind of Joker is this? The kind that cries on the inside.This is a Gotham Horror. Director and co-writer Todd Phillips has gone through Martin Scorsese's filmography ranging from Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy, Bringing Out the Dead to Shutter Island. Robert De Niro appears as a chat show host just to drive home the Scorsese connections.The Joker delivers a bravura performance from Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck. He is one of life's losers. Unable to hold down a job as a clown and on seven different kinds of medications but he is still a manic depressive.Set in the early 1980s, Gotham City is in the sewers and there are sightings of giant rats. Social services funding cuts means that Fleck is on his own. The social worker who does not even listen to him is not going to be there for him any more.Like Travis Bickle, Fleck snaps and is then reborn as the Joker. The Joker is not political but this nihilistic slow burn drama takes aim at wealthy Democrat and Republican politicians alike.Thomas Wayne might not be painted as a Trump, but he is a rich tycoon who thinks the 'have nots' are clowns. Watch out for the scene when the moguls dressed in tuxedos are watching a screening of Chaplin's Modern Times. A movie that commented on the desperate conditions many people faced during the 1930s Depression.Joker is a bold comic strip adaptation but it is a low wattage film with no plot. It is a tribute act because of the Scorsese movies that inspired it.",negative
"Low expectations and subverted expectations play a big part in this film's success, although not the biggest part. The levels of expectation on a DC 'universe' film is now pretty low - to the point that someone with film OCD like myself has not bothered to even dip a toe in recent years; likewise what one expects from a superhero genre origin story is not something like this. The sense of pleasant surprise certainly helped the success of the film, but it is not the main thing.The main reason is the central performance of Phoenix. He is totally committed to selling his character throughout, and even in the weakest moments of narrative, you believe his character in terms of its roots, development, and actions. It is not a film that would normally be associated with awards, but it would be a significant failure were he not to be recognized for how much he delivered and how much he made the film. A secondary reason the film works is its cinematic heritage in the films of Scorsese in so much as it falls between Taxi Driver and King of Comedy. This is not accidental, and the casting deserve a lot of credit of getting actors of the quality of Phoenix and de Niro (although the latter does more as a reference than an actor). With these elements working well, the film produces an engaging origin story that feels responsible but yet fitting the character. I could have done with it stopping just a few seconds earlier than it did, because I'm not sure that the ""maybe it was all imagined"" bit at the end was a good idea.Otherwise, it is enjoyably dark and deliberate, and is driven by Phoenix, even if the film is not as brilliant as some would have you believe.",positive
"This film is strictly a character development of Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) and how he transformed into The Joker. They could have done this in a number of different ways. In this film, he is a deranged vigilante in the battle of haves vs have nots. We do see Bruce Wayne as a child with Arthur many years his senior. It takes about 90 minutes until the big action happens. I was a bit disappointed when they made Joker brain-damaged rather than a criminal mastermind. The production takes place during the time span of about a month or so. His childhood is discussed, but not shown.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity. No Batman. No Harley Quinn.",negative
"From the likes of Caesar Romero, Jack Nicholson, Mark Hamill, Heath Ledger, Jared Leto and Zach Galifianakis, the iconic Batman/CD Comics character remains a highly distinctive and challenging role, and this stand-alone (not part of the DC Extended Universe, and no sequel planned, yet) explores his origins, from Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Todd Phillips (Road Trip, The Hangover, War Dogs). Basically, set in 1981, Gotham City, socially inept and mentally troubled Arthur Fleck (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Joaquin Phoenix) works as a clown-for-hire for a company called Ha-Ha's. He aspires to be a stand-up comedian, like his television hero, comic and talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro). Arthur lives with his mother, Penny (Frances Conroy) in a place rife with crime and unemployment, with much of the population disenfranchised and impoverished. Arthur suffers from a disorder that causes him to laugh at inappropriate times, he depends on social services for medication, and he is disregarded and mistreated by society. After being attacked in an alley by a gang Arthur's co-worker, Randall (Glenn Fleshler), lends him a gun. Arthur invites his neighbour, single mother Sophie Dumond (Zazie Beetz), to his debut stand-up comedy performance, and they begin dating. While entertaining at a children's hospital, Arthur's gun falls out of his pocket. Randall lies that Arthur bought the gun himself and Arthur is fired. On the subway, still in clown makeup, Arthur is beaten by three drunken Wayne Enterprises businessmen. He takes out the gun and shoots two of the men in self-defence and executes the third. The murders are condemned by billionaire Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), a candidate to become mayor of the city. He labels those envious of more successful people as ""clowns"". Demonstrations against Gotham's rich begin, with protesters donning clown masks. The social service program is hit by funding cuts, leaving Arthur without medication. Arthur's comedy show goes poorly; he laughs uncontrollably and has difficulty delivering his jokes. Murray Franklin mocks Arthur by showing clips from the routine on his show. Arthur berates his mother when she reveals the truth, as seen written in a letter to Thomas Wayne, alleging that he may be Thomas' illegitimate son. At Wayne Manor, Arthur talks to Thomas' young son, Bruce (Dante Pereira-Olson), but gets into a scuffle with family butler Alfred Pennyworth (Douglas Hodge) and flees. Following a visit from Gotham Police Detective Burke (Shea Whigham) and Detective Garrity (Bill Camp) who are investigating Arthur's involvement in the train murders, Penny suffers a stroke and is taken to hospital. At a public event, Arthur confronts Thomas, who tells him that Penny is delusional and not his biological mother. In denial, Arthur visits Arkham State Hospital and steals Penny's case file; it reveals that he was adopted as a baby and Penny allowed her abusive boyfriend to harm them both. Penny alleged that Thomas used his influence to fabricate the adoption and commit her to the asylum to hide their affair. Distraught, Arthur goes to the hospital and kills Penny, smothering her with a pillow. He enters Sophie's apartment unannounced; a frightened Sophie tells him to leave; their previous encounters were Arthur's delusions. Arthur is surprised to receive an invitation to appear on Murray's show due to the unexpected popularity of his routine clips. As he prepares, Arthur is visited by Randall and fellow ex-colleague Gary (Celebrity Juice's Leigh Gill). Arthur murders Randall in retaliation for getting him fired but allows Gary to leave unharmed for treating him well in the past. Arthur dyes his hair green, paints his face, and dons a new red suit ready for his performance. On the way to the studio, he is pursued by the two detectives onto a train filled with clown protesters. One accidentally shoots a protester and incites a riot, allowing Arthur to escape in the chaos. Before the show goes live, Arthur requests that Murray introduce him as Joker, a reference to Murray's previous mockery. Arthur walks out to a warm reception but tells morbid jokes. With nothing to lose, he admits that he killed the men on the train, and rants about how society abandons the disenfranchised and how Murray mocked him. Arthur kills Murray and is arrested as riots break out across Gotham. One rioter follows the Wayne family into an alley and murders Thomas and his wife Martha (Carrie Louise Putrello), sparing a traumatized Bruce. Rioters in an ambulance crash into the police car carrying Arthur and free him. He dances to the cheers of the crowd, satisfied that his dedication has finally been achieved. At Arkham, Arthur laughs to himself and tells his psychiatrist she would not understand the joke. He runs from orderlies, leaving a trail of bloody footprints. Also starring Brian Tyree Henry as Carl the Arkham Clerk and Hannah Gross as Young Penny. Phoenix delivers a chilling and compelling as the man who slowly loses his sanity and turns to a life of crime, and De Niro does well with his time onscreen as the man the luckless loner admires and one of the men (along Wayne) he obsesses over. This works well as a character study showing how monsters are made, an origins story about the Dark Knight's arch-nemesis, and a nod to the Martin Scorsese film The King of Comedy (and not just casting De Niro), and it makes room to take a swipe against at healthcare cuts and poverty. It is very controversial and very dark, with its crime elements, moments of violence and brutality, and featuring the song ""Rock and Roll Part 2"" by Gary Glitter (with what we know about the singer, it may be wrong to find this song catchy, but I don't care), and it is at times depressing and uncomfortable, but what else would you expect (?), a gritty and great psychological thriller. It won the Oscar for Best Original Score for Hildur Guðnadóttir, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Adapted Screenplay for Todd Phillips and Scott Silver, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Makeup and Hairstyling, Best Film Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Sound Editing, it won the BAFTAs for Original Music, and Best Casting, and it was nominated for Best Film, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Production Design, Best Make Up/Hair, and Best Sound, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Original Score, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Drama.

"One in four people will experience mental illness in their lifetime, but only a very small percentage of those will pose any sort of danger to anyone other than themselves. Hopefully, as more people talk about openly about mental health, stigma will decrease, and all those in need of help will get the treatment they require.There will, of course, always be cases that slip through the net with tragic results, people like Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), whose fragile psyche is the result of a lifetime of hurt: a victim of child abuse, a victim of violence, a victim of intolerance, a victim of circumstance, a victim of inequality, and a victim of a society that doesn't care. No longer functioning as a rational human being (his access to meds having been taken away), Fleck confuses reality and fantasy, is prone to outbursts of extreme violence, and dances wildly to inappropriate pop music from the '70s.With a tour-de-force performance from Phoenix, whose turn as the green-haired villain is both sympathetic and terrifying, plus stylish direction from Todd Phillips, and an intelligent script that is, by turns, funny, sad, exciting, and horrific, Joker is a refreshingly bold attempt to do something with a well known comic-book character that doesn't involve expensive CGI-laden battles.9/10.

"With sections of New York and New Jersey standing in for Gotham City this movie depicts the origin story of The Joker. Joaquin Phoenix is Arthur Fleck, still living in a small apartment with his mother, working menial jobs he can get with the ambition to be a successful stand up comic. But life often deals us hard knocks for no reason at all and Arthur, with his own mental illness driving him, has increasing difficulty handling them. It all comes to a head when on the subway, dressed in his clown suit after a job, when he gets accosted by three Wall Street types.The thing about the actor Phoenix, he always puts himself out there totally, he always has. He is just perfect here, his demeanor, his body language, his facial expressions, even the awkward way he runs. He deserves his Best Actor Oscar.This is set at the time when Bruce Wayne was a young boy, the time that he witnessed his parents being killed in the alley after a theater performance. There is a brief encounter at the gates of the Wayne home, of the eventual Batman and the eventual Joker.I really didn't think I'd like this movie but it really is a fine one, even though fiction of course it shows how mental illness greatly influences the trajectory of one's life. It was also fun to see Robert De Niro as late night show host Murray Franklin, patterned after the old Johnny Carson show, even with a trumpeter as the band leader.I watched it at home on BluRay from my public library, my wife skipped.

"Right, with all the praise and hype that the 2019 movie ""Joker"" from director Todd Phillips have been getting, this is very much a movie that you'd eventually find your way to watching.I did so too, and let me just say that expectations were high when I sat down to watch ""Joker"". Expectations that the movie didn't live up to. Man, this movie was definitely not my cup of tea.First of all, the pacing of the movie. Talk about being prolonged and dragging on, without nothing much of any real worth happening. Sure Joaquin Phoenix did a great job in his acting performance as Arthur Fleck and the gradual downward sloping trip towards becoming the Joker.But the storyline wasn't really one that did much to get me worked up. Director Todd Phillips took quite his time to get from A to B, and without dishing out much in terms of phenomenal storytelling and movie presentation along the way.There was one scene, a single scene, that was glorious, and it was when Arthur Fleck was on the Murray Franklin show and what happened to Murray Franklin on live TV. That scene actually had me laughing. But the rest of the movie was somewhat of a slow-paced drag to sit through. Sure, it was somewhat entertaining, but awfully slow paced. However, this is hardly a movie that I will be watching a second time around.Aside from Joaquin Phoenix in the lead, the movie also bolstered performances from the likes of Robert De Niro and Frances Conroy, whom individually were adding something good to the movie, just a shame that they didn't have more screen time.I don't understand why critics are so worked up about this movie, I honestly don't. It wasn't all that particularly outstanding or entertaining. Sure, it is a movie about an iconic villain in the DC universe, but that is about as far as it goes.I am rating this overhyped and overrated movie a less than mediocre four out of ten stars.",negative
"Why does this movie exist? Who does it exist for? Why do people love it so much?These questions reverberated inside my head as it played in front of me. I was waiting for a moment where I would be awestruck, blasted by its sublime genius that so many people had trumped up or maybe even worried by the philosophy that so many people were worried about.I felt absolutely nothing.Joker might seem like a good movie if you've never seen Taxi Driver or The King of Comedy. But here's my struggle. Those movies have something to say. Something to prove. They aspire to be art when this film is simply commerce.If you think this is a good film, tell me what it has to say. Tell me the meaning of it and why it exists other than, ""The Joker is cool"" or ""This is the Joker's origin story."" What is the purpose of watching a man's horrible life that never gets better and only gets worse and then the lives he touches get destroyed along the way.I mean, is it a cliche to use that sound and fury signifying nothing quote when this movie is so rote that it uses the song ""White Room"" in perhaps the most obvious of ways? Nothing is unexpected. Nothing is unique. This movie is the definition of wallpaper, albeit wallpaper bought by a tween at Hot Topic because they desperately yearn for something, anything, to make them seem different than the herd while mooing their way through the fields of utter boredom.Director Todd Phillips started his career by directing Hated: GG Allin and the Murder Junkies while he was still a junior at NYU. His second film, Frat House, won the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance before HBO bought it. It never aired, as many of the film's participants claimed they were paid to enact the scenes in the movie.A third film, the Phish-following Bittersweet Motel, was his last documentary before making the movies Road Trip and Old School for producer Ivan Reitman. His career since has been a series of successes, like Starsky & Hutch, School for Scoundrels, Due Date and The Hangover series.Which brings us to this movie.It's written by Scott Silver, who wrote 8 Mile - good - and X-Men Origins: Wolverine - bad. He also wrote The Fighter, which won him an Oscar nomination.I always feel like you should say something nice first.So here's goes.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is great. It's acting desperately searching for a better movie to be in. His goal was to play a character that audiences couldn't identify with - that seems odd for the main role in a movie - studying assassins instead of people who had played the Joker before.He plays Arthur Fleck, who starts out the film as a party clown and aspiring stand-up comedian who lives with his mother Penny (Francis Conroy, every season of American Horror Story). A disorder causes him to laugh out loud for no reason and he depends on the government for his meds.An attack while working as a clown leaves him needing a gun, a gun that falls out of his pocket while working in a children's hospital. He also begins dating his neighbor Sophie (Zazie Beats, who was in Deadpool 2 and Slice) and finds that a video of him on stage has gone viral, ending up on his favorite TV program, The Murray Franklin Show.The fact that Robert DeNiro is inversing his The King of Comedy role, playing Jerry Langford instead of Rupert Pumpkin, is the type of creativity normally reserved for college freshmen who believe they are the first people to ever read Herman Hesse.Arthur is beaten up by three drunken Wayne Enterprises businessmen. He shoots two of them in self-defense before feeling so good about himself that he kills the third. This leads to Thomas Wayne - who Arthur's mother believes is her son's father - denouncing whoever did this killing as a clown.Soon, people are rioting in the streets wearing clown masks and Arthur is finally feeling like his life has meaning. However, two Gotham cops visit his mother, looking for the killer of the businessmen, and she has a stroke. This causes Arthur to either go off the deep end or become sane, as his meds have run out. He realizes that he has no girlfriend and that everything in his mind has been a lie.This brings him to The Murray Franklin Show, where he embraces the name The Joker, inciting another riot that also leads to Joe Chill killing the Waynes inside Crime Alley after a showing of Zorro The Gay Blade. Yes, that really happens.Another potentially crazy person was angered by this movie. Jared Leto, who portrayed the Joker in Suicide Squad and reportedly sent used condoms and dead rats to his co-stars, was alienated and upset by the fact that Warner Brothers was making a Joker movie without him. He even left his agents over this and attempted to get people to cancel this movie.I've heard words like groundbreaking and Oscar being thrown about because of this movie. As a society, we've really devalued those two words, huh?This is a movie that may not even be about the real Joker. It might not even connect to anything. And it's a movie about a man forgotten and thrown away that becomes somebody before being nobody. It's also a waste of two hours of your time.Man, I should work in some other nice things. The cinematography feels large in scope, when so many other films seem small these days. I also loved seeing the old Warner Brothers logo.I mean, this won the Gold Lion at the Venice Film Festival. It also had an eight-minute long standing ovation.I sat there waiting, hoping, struggling to find one moment of entertainment and relevance and walked away saying, ""That was a movie."" It should be something more.Instead, I'll have to see people wearing this costume and thinking it has some significance. These are the same people who think naming the comedy club ""Pogo's Comedy Club"" is daring because it references John Wayne Gacy instead of hammer soft irony.We deserve better and have become so mired in the dross that we think that movies like this are worth something. I'm not being an elitist - I love popcorn films and if you read this site you know I have a soft spot for Italian horror and 80's slashers - but when I see something that is s***, I have to call it the purest s*** I've seen in years.",negative
"This film tells how the Joker comes to be the villain he is. The problem is that it is so effective and compelling, that I really empathise with the Joker and his horrible life experiences. Batman's father is portrayed as the villain, and the Joker is the victim. It juxtaposes good and bad. How is the next Batman film going to work, when Batman's now the son of the bad guy?",positive
"A masterpiece! Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is a pathetic loser in Gotham's fractured society circa early 1980s. By day a clown-for-hire and by night an aspiring stand-up comic Being a successful comedian he could better care for his sick elderly mother living in a rundown apartment. Arthur has a neurological malady that has him breaking out in screeching laughter at inopportune situations. Suffering humiliation and raw despair, his comedy is flat and tends to lead to violence. When the dysfunctional comic gets his hands on a gun discovers what talent he possess is not for comedy. One bad decision after another brings Fleck to the center of a chain reaction of chaos giving a new origin myth of Batman's notable supervillain opponent...The Joker!.Phoenix's performance is pure brilliance. Also featured are: Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz, Bill Camp, Shea Willingham, Frances Conroy and Brett Cullen.",positive
"I've seen this film twice now at the IMAX, and it just gets better. Like everyone else I expect (as with Rami Malek last year) that Joaquin Phoenix will be a shoe-in for all of the major Best Actor awards (he is currently better than odds-on in the UK for both the BAFTA & the Oscar) and very deservedly so. His almost schizophrenic performance is both sensitive and brutal; haunting and terrifying in equal measure; the screenplay is engrossing and Todd Phillips keeps you captivated for a terrific two hours of cinema. Given current events in Hong Kong and, to a lesser extent, the activities of Extinction Revolution; the ending depicted here does not seem nearly as far-fetched as it ought to!! Super stuff!",positive
"There really is not definitive ""Addams Family"" when it comes to films and TV. This is because the Charles Addams cartoons on which they have been based really were not originally intended to be anything other than single panel comics. They were not fleshed out stories about the family...that began with 1964's ""The Addams Family"" television show. But this film version really is its own creation...not cute or nice like the television show at all. In this case, the family is actually homicidal...as they are its sequel. Because of this, I strongly recommend you don't let younger kids watch it...it's NOT kid-friendly...at least not for younger ones. And, if you do let them watch, please watch it with them, as the films never were intended for young kids and they are NOT cute and cuddly like the original TV incarnation. No, they are edgier and more dangerous in the movies. Well made but also not exactly comedies in the traditional sense.",positive
"Well, I finally managed to write a review on this, and I have to say, I like this a lot. I do think Values is marginally better, but both are solid entertainment, two good examples of films, driven by character not plot(though there was a very good one in both films). Like Values, the rating is too low, why? My only criticism, is that I don't like the rap song over the end credits at all. Apart from that, it had spirited direction, great incidental music, great performances, and a gem of a black humour filled script.The plot is simple but grabs the attention of adults, as young children might not understand it. The script is witty, dark and very funny, something that Reunion forgot to add to the proceedings. Barry Sonnenfield directs with spirit and enthusiasm, but it's the performances that I was most impressed with.Raul Julia and Angelica Huston were perfect as Gomez and Morticia, and I was sure that Tim Curry and Daryl Hannah would have been, had they a half-decent script and director to work with.(alas!) Christopher Lloyd was great fun as Fester, but the performance of Christina Ricci steals the film. Everyone else deserves a mention.In conclusion, a well-done and inventive film, with a 9/10 from me! Bethany Cox",positive
"I remember watching THE ADDAMS FAMILY as a kid and not being overly impressed with it even then: I preferred the more subtle ghoulish humour of the original '60s TV series. Watching the film again as an adult, I can see that time has not been kind to this outing, with the endless dated early '90s effects work and quickly tiring madcap pace.It's as if the writers have taken the family members from the original show and plonked them into the middle of a quick-fire comedy. Everything is noisy, brash and over-the-top, and the likes of Raul Julia are frankly quite embarrassing with their endless scenery chewing which grates on the viewer before long. Only Christopher Lloyd and Christina Ricci prove a real fit for their parts, and funnily enough they get all the best gags and one-liners.Although the overly complicated script has to take its share of responsibility, I think Barry Sonnenfeld's tiresome direction is to blame; remember that this guy is the king of FX-heavy comedies (he later made MEN IN BLACK). Had things been dialled down and delivered in a more mannered and focused way I probably would have enjoyed this a great deal more.",negative
"The Addams are an unique wealthy macabre family. Their corrupted lawyer Tully Alford (Dan Hedaya) owns money to a loan shark. Together they plot to inject a fake Uncle Fester Addams (Christopher Lloyd) into the family so he could search for the family treasure of gold Doubloons.Barry Sonnenfeld has created a well made Gothic Addams world. The family is played by Anjelica Huston, Raul Julia, and Christina Ricci as young Wednesday Addams. This is mostly amusing especially what Wednesday keep doing to Pugsley. All the performers are wonderful. They have all the fun creating these amazing characters. The whole setup is incredibly inventive. The story itself is a bit of a grind. It would be better for the Family to clash more with the 'normal' suburban life. The regular jobs are funny. The kids should wreck havoc on regular school. That's the better sweet spot.",positive
"For middle age generation, one of sources of good memories. For performances, for dark story, for humor, for the status of sketch for Adams family life and for the comfortable end. Imagination and good performances. And, sure, Raul Julia",positive
"The Addams Family is an American 95-minute movie from 1991, so this one has its 25th anniversary this year. The director is Barry Sonnenfeld and the characters are based on the work of Charles Addams. This movie was nominated for an Oscar in the costume category where it lost to Bugsy and Anjelica Huston was nominated for a Golden Globe that she lost to Bette Midler. So you already hear that Oscar winner Huston is in here, but there are more known names such as Christopher Lloyd (BttF), the late Raul Julia or the very young Christina Ricci, which means the cast is pretty exquisite. But no matter how colorfully they play their roles, this film is eventually just all about styles, costumes and sets as well as makeup really. It's about a family of undead and we see them during their everyday life as well as during their not so everyday life. There are many references to torture and murder in here, but it is all pretty funny and light. This film is a comedy fantasy movie and there is no intention from anybody to make this look like a horror film despite the protagonists.In my opinion, this was not really a good watch. Maybe it was okay by the standards back then, but I must say by today's standards the film has not aged well at all. This refers to the story mostly that I just did not find interesting or entertaining at all. It all felt very gimmicky and just one scene follows the next in which the filmmakers tried to entertain the audience in a slightly shocking fashion, but there is no coherent plot in this movie despite the filmmakers trying pretty hard sometimes to achieve such. They weren't successful. Here and there, there was a somewhat memorable line (quote) or scene, but it was just not enough, neither in terms of quality, not in terms of quantity. Addams died a couple years before this film came out, but I somehow don't feel he really would have appreciated the outcome here. It is fairly underwhelming in my opinion. It is not a complete failure by any means, but looking at how popular and known the film's title still is today and how the characters are somewhat known too (especially Ricci's and Huston's), I was very unimpressed. The comedy also becomes repetitive fairly quickly. Thumbs down from me and I do not recommend the watch.",negative
"Certainly there are going to be those who take this comic variation on ""Tales From the Darkside"" as something that was influenced by the devil with its irreverent take on family structure and focus on characters who obviously seem to take great pleasure in following some seemingly morbid characteristics. Yes, they are indeed absolutely ookie, with gorgeous mom Morticia (that's Anjelica Huston, not Cher...), extremely sexy dad Gomez (a very dreamy Raul Julia), the witch-like Grandma (Judith Malina), portly Pugsly (Jimmy Workman) and the very dour Wednesday (a delightful Christina Ricci) not the Brady Bunch, not the Cunninghams, not the Cleavers, and very far even from the Munsters. Gomez has been mourning the disappearance of his brother Fester (which means ""to rot"") for years, and every year like clockwork on the anniversary of his disappearance, they do a séance to try and find out where he is. Thanks to some con-artist clients of the family attorney (Dan Heydara), ""Fester"" does show up during the séance, actually the son of a hard-hearted con-artist (a very funny Elizabeth Wilson). She pretends to be his psychiatrist, having ""discovered"" him in the midst of the Bermuda triangle. Cynical Wednesday is suspicious, and this eventually leads to the Addams being removed from their own home so ""Fester"" and mommie dearest can find out where the family fortune is being hidden.Lavishly filmed with fun special effects and gorgeously morbid art direction, the film version of the famous comic strip and 1960's T.V. series is perfectly cast. It seems that nobody could replaced Carolyn Jones as the luscious Morticia, but Ms. Huston does a phenomenal job and is obviously having a ton of fun, especially after being haggard as an evil witch just a few years earlier. Raul Julia is not as tongue-in-cheek as John Astin was, but his Gomez is certainly unforgettable with an undeniable sex appeal. Anjelica and Raul have amazing chemistry, making it clear that this morbidly old married couple are very much in love. Those who saw Raul in the original Broadway cast of ""Nine"" will agree that after playing that role, nobody else could have done this role justice.Some people are going to confuse Dana Ivey, the talented stage actress who plays Heydara's neglected wife Margaret Alford, with the legendary Maggie Smith as they do have similar facial features. Lots of old friends truly thought Ivey's character in ""The Color Purple"" was Maggie Smith until I pointed out her name in the credits. What happens to her character here is truly bizarre, but in a magnificently funny way. Carel Struycken is an amusing Lurch, but unfortunately never gets to say Ted Cassidy's famous line, ""You Rang?"", only being silent with the exception of a few grunts when things don't seem right to him. Take the satanic references with a grain of salt or you might find yourself as crazy and ookie as the bizarre characters (both dead and alive) here. The film also features a magnificent party sequence which utilizes a classic movie tradition of switching from two characters dancing alone to the switch to the party in full swing. When Julia and Lloyd break into ""The Mamushka"", the film becomes absolutely delightful. There's really nothing offensive in the things the Addams family does. It's just all silly fun, and if you watch it with that in mind, you won't need to ""cleanse"" yourself afterwords with a hot shower.",positive
"The Addams family are far from being normal but they are rich and as such are their attorney's only chance of getting rich. Tully has debts up the yazoo and the only thing that stops his knees being violently replaced with fresh air is the fact that Abigail Craven's son Gordon looks eerily like Gomez's missing brother Fester. Shaving his head, Gordon enters the Addams home as Fester and tries to use his spare time to get into the family vault. However Gomez's joy at his return is gradually marred by a sneaking feeling that Fester is not himself  meanwhile Wednesday has no such doubts at all and is out to expose the impostor.One of the few remakes that actually works, The Addams Family takes the Gothic humour of the TV series and makes it feel fresh and entertaining. The story is essentially a nail for us to hang our coats on so we can watch the gags come but even with this it is actually pretty good. Making one of the family a ""new character"" is a clever way of adding to the formula without having to bring in new characters to lead the film and it does work. Within this frame the twisted comedy is rather entertaining and, although rarely laugh out loud funny, it is still consistently amusing and enjoyable.The cast are roundly good. Julia is a perfect Gomez and Huston is a great Morticia despite the latter being a fairly one-note affair. Lloyd is enjoyable in the lead and manages to do well to carry the ""new character"" aspect of Fester without disrupting the dynamic of the family. Ricci is excellent and the only downside is that the film doesn't give her enough to do; Workman is also good and has good chemistry with her. Hedaya, Wilson, Ivey and others are strong in support and generally do well to shore up the story.Overall a kooky affair that is enjoyable in you are in the mood for its particular brand of dark silliness. The plot is more than enough to act as a frame, the jokes maybe don't hit many real highs but they do consistently get very close to the target and the fact that the actors all buy into the joke makes it that little bit better. An enjoyable remake that succeeds because it has the strength to stand as its own beast.",positive
"The Addams Family - depending on when you have grown up, there might be another version of this that you are more familiar than this. Most recent ones have been animated and a new one is in the pipeline as they say, with Rob Zombie at the helm (and of course his wife, which has become grounds for many jokes/memes recently) - and that new one may be the reason this is quite popular right now. Or the fact it is availabel to watch for free on a streaming service.All that aside, what a wonderful cast put together. And what fine effects for the 90s for sure. And that theme music ... might bring some memories back. Even if not, it is so catchy you'll be on it before you know it. Some horror elements and even some sexual themes may be a bit too much for some kids, but I don't think they'll catch on to most of the underlying things (meant for adults watching anyway).Funny throughout with certain morbid tendencies, this can be a lot of fun, visually speaking and in terms of acting.",positive
"The Addams Family has had a death... Fester Addams. But lo and behold, their lawyer knows a man who resembles Fester and if he passes the impostor off, could gain access to the family vault, full of treasures untold. But can the fake Fester survive the family's maniacal games? I don't have much experience with older incarnations of the Addams Family. So, I can't make an educated comparison. However, this film excels in every way: macabre, humorous and just plain eccentrically absurd. The casting is also amazing... Raul Julia in the performance of his career, and Christopher Lloyd in a very offebeat role even for him.This was a breakout performance for Christina Ricci (playing Wednesday Addams). Sure, it possibly typecast her into weird roles (""Casper"", ""Sleepy Hollow"", ""Pumpkin"") but this is, beyond a doubt, where she fits. She can do drama (""Monster"", ""Black Snake Moan"") but will always be America's goth girl.This film's dark humor is family appropriate -- cartoon violence, no nudity and marginal language. They simply do not make films like this anymore. Full credit must be given to the writer and director for bringing this family to life in a way that just cannot be repeated. Well, aside from the sequel.",positive
"Based on the popular TV series (which there were a few of) and New Yorker cartoons - from the characters created by Charles Addams - comes this live action feature film about the kooky, spooky, eccentric and darkly comical humorous family, from director Barry Sonnenfeld (Men in Black). Basically The Addams Family are the strange scary movie stereotypes filled clan, with wife/mother Morticia (Anjelica Huston), husband/father Gomez (Raul Julia), the witch-like Granny (Judith Malina), Frankenstein's monster like butler Lurch (Carel Struycken), and the kids, Wednesday (young Christina Ricci) and Pugsley (Jimmy Workman). Notice anyone missing, yes, Uncle Fester (Christopher Lloyd) disappeared 25 years ago after a fight with brother Gomez, and Abigail Craven (Elizabeth Wilson) wants to try and get the Addams' fortune, by using her ""son"" Gordon (Lloyd again), who has a striking resemblance to Fester, to con his way into the family, and find the fortune. As time goes by though, Gordon slowly finds himself settling very nicely as if he really was Fester, oh, and by the end, you realise it is really him, Craven found him with amnesia. Also starring Dan Hedaya as Tully Alford, Dana Ivey as Margaret Alford and Paul Benedict as Judge Womack. The dark comedy is wonderfully strange, the performances from Julia, Huston and Lloyd are marvellous, young Ricci also shines with her moments as the daughter, just a very good dark comedy film. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Costume Design, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Make Up Artist and Best Production Design. Very good!",positive
"Generally, speaking this a pretty ""fun movie"" for most people, kids and adults. I think ""fun"" is the adjective most people would use in describing this film.As one who remembered the television series, I thought I would check this out, too. Angelica Huston certainly didn't match Carolyn Jones' beauty but she, along with Raul Julia, Christopher Lloyd and Christinia Ricci all were entertaining to watch.There certainly were no end to the colorful imagines, unique scenes and dialog, special-effects and - for those with a surround system, good sound. It all made for an entertaining and fast-moving film.I didn't find a lot of laugh-out-loud moments but it did bring a lot of smiles to my face. A lot of this is dark humor, so it helps to appreciate that type of comedy.",positive
"I've not seen the television version of The Addams Family so I can't say how this film compares; I can say it was a lot of fun though. As the film starts Gomez Addams is still lamenting the loss of his older brother Fester twenty-five years ago. He is soon visited by a lawyer who is hoping the get his hands on the Addams' family fortune so he can pay off his debts; his initial scheme fails but when he meets the son of the woman he owes money to he seems a striking resemblance to Fester. Soon the look-alike is trying to get into the family and most of them believe he is indeed the long lost Fester; young Wednesday is more suspicious though. As he stays with them trying to find a way into the vault he finds himself growing to like them and Wednesday starts to trust him too.This film is a lot of fun, Raul Julia and Angelica Huston were great as Gomez and his wife Morticia and Christopher Lloyd was a lot of fun as Fester; however young Christina Ricci managed to steal every scene she was in; playing Wednesday Addams she managed to only smile once and when she did it was a very creepy smile, it is just a shame she didn't have a larger role. While this is suitable for most ages some scenes may be a bit scary for younger viewers; one scene where Wednesday and her brother perform at school might be a little to gory for some as gallons of obviously fake blood are sprayed about!",positive
"Gordon Craven (Christopher Lloyd), a dead ringer for The Addams' long lost Uncle Fester, poses as the missing relative in order to get his hands on the freaky family's fortune, hidden in the bowels of their spooky mansion.I find the humour in Barry Sonnenfeld's big screen debut for The Addams Family more amusing than side-splitting, but I can't fault the casting, the lively, spot-on performances ensuring that a good time is had throughout: in particular, Christopher Lloyd as Uncle Fester and Christina Ricci as Wednesday Addams are inspired choices. Another aspect of the film that makes it more success than failure is the production design, from the wonderful interiors of the Addams' mansion, to the amazing costumes, to the top-notch special effects. Throw in a suitably ooky score by Marc Shaiman and what you have is an entertaining 99 minutes of morbid fun for all the family.The ghoulish gags come thick and fast, there's a fun musical number (the Mamushka!), Pugsley (Jimmy Workman) and Wednesday add some grand guignol to their school play, Elizabeth Wilson (as Gordon's loanshark mother Abigail) does a great comedic German accent, and Thing gets a job with FedEx!6.5/10 for the film, plus a bonus point for being the inspiration for one of the best pinball machines of the '90s (second only to The Twilight Zone). So that's 7.5/10, rounded down to 7 for that awful Addam's rap by M. C. Hammer (such an early '90s thing).",positive
"From the Charles Addams comic-strip about ghoulish yet fun-loving family, here taking in a long lost relative who is in reality a gold-digging impostor. Well-cast and acted, smartly paced and designed comedy is an improvement on the material over the popular television series of the mid-1960s. Still, this screenplay is full of repetitive jokes and groaners; the picture looks better than it plays, with an incredible art direction, costumes and make-up. One is likely to watch and enjoy it, yet wishing it were funnier, crazier. The gags don't spin off into orbit, and eventually the whole thing evaporates from memory. Followed by a sequel, ""Addams Family Values"", in 1993. ** from ****",positive
"Being a kid from the 80's, this film was my very first acquaintance with the legendary ""The Addams Family"", and only watched the mid-60s TV-series (starring John Astin as the original Gomez Addams) much later. I am a big fan of the concept of sarcastic black comedy; however, and therefore I was very much looking forward to Sonnenfeld's film. The daily rituals of this family are just great! Mom and dad and their macabre passion for each other, siblings constantly thinking up games to murder each other, and a bodiless hand racing around the massive Gothic mansion! It's all very sinisterly and depressingly portrayed, but the humor is hilarious and ultra-effective. Admittedly, the whole concept exclusively revolves around one gag, namely a sort of behavioral inversion, but it works every single time! The characters remain serious no matter what crazed madness they proclaim, and even the driest forms of vulgarity are considered to be the most normal things in the world. The scenery and locations are simply brilliant, and all the supportive characters that walk through the screen (Cousin It, Dr. Pider-Schloss, a Siamese twin, ...) carry a special place in my heart. Uncle Fester Addams, Gomez' long lost brother, returns to the family, but he's brainwashed into an imposter by greedy lawyers in order to steal the Addams' family fortune. My best advice is to repeatedly watch ""The Addams Family"" and its sequel, because the number of gags, hidden references, and little trivia details there are to discover is endless. This is simply one of the funniest comedies I ever saw, although not for everyone's taste. Barry Sonnenfeld's direction is occasionally very uneven, but it was only his first major assignment after primarily working as a cameraman. Still, you can't help thinking how even more awesome this film must have been if Tim Burton (the producers' preferred choice) would have helmed it.I simply can't go without mentioning the cast! I hope they paid good money to whoever was in charge of casting. Every character in the family is just delightfully chosen and you are guaranteed to forevermore associate them with the roles they played here. Anjelica Huston as the gorgeous witch, Raul Julia (who was sadly never able to enjoy the success of the films for a long time) as the poetic madman, Christopher Lloyd as the white-faced and shiny bald-headed Fester, Carl Struyken as the towering Lurch, etc! Special mention to Christina Ricci, who truly bewitched me. She's the same age as me, and when I first saw this film at the theater, I fell head over heels in love with her! It's amazing how she depicts Wednesday Addams! She doesn't move a muscle when she speaks, and her appearance is charismatic and spooky at the same time! 'The Addams Family' is highly recommended entertainment and easily one of those few comedies you'll never grow tired off. The entire cast and crew returned for an equally enjoyable sequel in 1993.",positive
"The Addams Family has the Addams family debt laden almost bankrupt lawyer Tully Alford (Dan Hedaya) & his wife Margaret (Dana Ivey) being invited to an annual séance held by the Addams family to remember Gomez Addams (Raul Julia) Brother, Fester who mysteriously disappeared 25 years ago. Back at his office Alford is threatened by loan shark Abigail Craven (Elizabeth Wilson) & her brute of a son Gordon (Christopher Lloyd) who want their money. Alford says he has no money but knows where there is a vault full of treasure & that her son Gordon looks exactly like Fester who disappeared 25 years ago & that with his help they can rob the Addams family of all their money. Later that night at the séance Gomez his wife Morticia (Anjelica Huston), Grandma (Judith Malina) & the two children Wednesday (Christina Ricci) & Pugsley (Jimmy Workman) are all astounded & delighted when Fester suddenly & rather unexpectedly turns up having supposedly been trapped in the Bermuda Triangle... Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld I thought The Addams Family was a fine film that provides solid entertainment but at the same time is maybe a little simplistic & not quite funny enough. The Addams Family first appeared as a series of cartoons by Charles Addams in 1935, then the character's were given their own TV series The Addams Family (1964 - 1966) which ran for 64 episodes, then Hanna-Barbera turned the concept into a short-lived cartoon series that ran for 16 episodes in 1973 & there was one spin-off TV special called Halloween with the Addams Family (1977) with most of the original cast which then brings us to this big budget film version. The script by Caroline Thompson & Larry Wilson with Paul Rudnick doing the rewrites moves along at a nice pace & isn't demanding, it has the sort of macabre black humour you would expect & is good fun. I have to admit that I personally didn't really laugh at any point, I certainly smiled & found it amusing but there weren't any big laugh-out-loud moments for me & anyone who doesn't guess the 'surprise' ending within the first ten minutes is either dead or just plain stupid. All the Addams Family character's are there including Lurch (Carel Struycken) the ridiculously tall butler & Thing the dismembered hand. The cast help the film enormously, Julia as Gomez is perfect as is Huston as Morticia while a young Christinia Ricci is very effective as Wednesday. With a supposed budget of $38,000,000 back in '91 The Addams Family is technically a very good looking & polished film with the Addamses' Gothic mansion standing out & almost being a character in it's own right. The special effects vary as one would expect from a film from '91, the special effects on Thing are surprisingly good while the wind & electricity effects at the end are awful by todays standards. The recognisable Addams Family theme tune is only used during the opening credits. Director Sonnenfeld keeps things moving with plenty of visual gags & slapstick comedy, although I felt the sequence where Wednesday cuts Pugsley's arm off in a school play & in return he slits her throat with fountains of spurting blood spraying from the wounds was somewhat disturbing & felt out of place as in the context of the film I think they did it for 'real'. I liked it, I'm not sure I would want to watch it again anytime soon. Definitetly worth a watch especially as you can probably find it cheap these days or catch it on TV for free, like I did in fact!",positive
"Comedy rarely comes blacker than this nor as magical. We open with a great sight gag which is lifted directly from one of Addams' New Yorker cartoons. As carollers sing their hearts out at the front door of the celebrated Addams house we slowly pan up to the roof where, en masse, the family tilt a large cauldron of boiling oil toward the carollers. We cut away before the oil actually leaves the cauldron because the story is not about this, it merely serves to establish the kind of family we're dealing with and, in the case of Addams veterans/devotees, to provide a bonus via animating one of the classic cartoons. There's a plot of sorts but it's not allowed to get in the way of the blend of sight gags and one liners that are deftly placed and explode like cherry bombs throughout the running time. The acting is uniformly good to excellent and it will, I am sure, sustain a second viewing.",positive

"I haven't seen the original Addams Family series, I've only seen the three movies and the cartoon series, and I have to say that this is far better than the cartoon series. Every single character is perfectly casted in this film; Raul Julia does a great Gomez, Anjelica Huston is perfect as the dangerously slim, french-loving Morticia, Christoper Lloyd is flawless a Fester, Christina Ricci does a chillingly good Wednesday, which is quite impressive at that age(she was 10 or 11 when they made this), and Jimmy Workman is also great as Pugsley. Carel Struycken and Christopher Hart also do good jobs, portraying Lurch and Thing respectively, but since one of them is a giant who never speaks, and the other is a disembodied hand, I wouldn't really classify it as acting, though they're great at what they do. The script and plot seems a little awkward and reeks of lack of good ideas. It seems like they couldn't figure out how to introduce the characters, without the age-old plot of having a new character be introduced to something that is completely different to him and the audience, while it seems perfectly normal to the characters that it's trying to introduce. It just seems tired and borderline cliché-like. I would have preferred to, at the very least, see some completely new character show up and be introduced, both to us and to the Addams family, rather than having someone who appears to be Fester show up with amnesia. Apart from that, the film is great. The plot does seem a bit tiresome, but it never really gets dull; I guess this film is actually more eventful than the next in the series, but I'll have to compare after I see it again. It has a good pace throughout, and continues to entertain through most of the film, with good gags and jokes for every single scene. The acting was, like I mentioned earlier, pretty much flawless, at least by all of the leads and the most important supporting characters. Every single member of the Addams family was just about perfect. The one complaint is Huston as Morticia, who, as my fiancée pointed out, hasn't got the walk down. Actually, that's kind of the problem... she does walk. She should kind of float, with the tight dress. The characters are well-written and sufficiently bizarre and grotesque, as is the great black humor. The make-up has some flaws... Julia and Lloyd aren't quite pale enough, though last-mentioned goes back and forth some(personally, I attribute that to the character... you'll understand once you've seen the entire film), and Anjelica... well, with the white face, the blue eyeshadow and the bright red lipstick, she looks like a clown or a mime. You kept wondering when she was going to make a balloon animal... or at least, my fiancée did. And on thinking back, I have to agree with her. Still, the whole film is a worthy watch for any fan of any of the actors and probably of the Addams family as well. I recommend it to fans of any of the actors(as all of them give some of their best performances) and fans of black comedy. 7/10",positive
"The Addam's Family T.V. show was a bit before my time but that's not to say I couldn't enjoy this movie. I had a cursory idea who the Addam's Family was back in '91 when this movie was released, although I was more familiar with the Munsters (I saw more of those reruns).The Addam's Family are a gothic somewhat paranormal family that revel in all things morbid. Death, dismemberment, and destruction bring them joy. They're attracted to anything hinting towards gross, ghastly, and gory--unclean, uncouth, and unpleasant. Their family is strange, slightly monsterish and a delight to watch.I think they brought it to the screen very well with splendid performances from Raul Julia as Gomez, Anjelica Huston as Morticia, and the young Christina Ricci as Wednesday. The movie wasn't Earth shattering, but it did move the needle.",positive
"The Addams Family (1991): Dir: Barry Sonnenfeld / Cast: Raul Julia, Anjelica Huston, Christopher Lloyd, Elizabeth Wilson, Dan Hedaya: Big screen adaptation of the classic TV show about the monstrous family that are totally outside traditional values. Raul Julia and Anjelica Huston look the parts of Gomez and Morticia, the head couple with Pugsley and Wednesday as their two demented children who have the disturbing past time of finding methods of execution. Christopher Lloyd plays Uncle Fester who went missing twenty-five years ago. He turns up with a couple of the most forgettable villains the screenwriter can conjure up. Elizabeth Wilson poises as a psychiatrist claiming that Fester was lost in the Bermuda Triangle and lost his memory. He is told that he is Gordon who she brought him in. Lloyd as Fester is sent to possess the Addams fortune but predictable elements occurs such as his growing close to the family. Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld who presents the film's look and the special effects and art direction hold appeal with a black and white mostly presentation. While the Addams cast play their roles with appeal but the villains played by Wilson and Dan Hedaya have less personality than the severed life hand, Thing. This is not a great film but for those who loved the TV show, they will enjoy the recreation and bizarre nature of this odd family. Score: 7 ½ / 10",positive
"For 25 years uncle Fester has been missing. An evil doctor finds out and introduces a fake Fester in an attempt to get the Addams Family's money. Daughter Wednesday has some doubts as to the sincerity of the her uncle Fester. The fake uncle adapts very well to the family, but can the doctor carry out her evil plans and take over the Addams Family's fortune......It's a remake of a TV show, and just like most TV to movie adaptations, it's just a series of clumsy sketches weakly held together by a flimsy plot.Luckily then, the cast put their all into it, and make somewhat more watchable than it should be.Sonnenfeld has made a sumptuous looking film, and one thinks he must have been watching Batman and Beetlejuice on loop whilst making this, because it's very Burtonesque, which isn't a bad thing.But it's one of those movies that you will forget about no sooner than when you switch it off.Fun, but very hollow.Like a cheap Easter egg.",negative
"This film adaptation of the Addam's Family has its moments and is watchable, but there are just certain things about it that do not work that cause it to be a sort of all right comedy rather than a really good one. Part of the problem is the casting, but then the casting is good as well. Raul Julie is perfectly cast as Gomez and is a very bright spot in this film. A shame Addam's Family Values was not his last movie instead of the horrid Street Fighter movie. Christopher Lloyd plays Fester, and while he is not my first choice the man can play any role from Fester, to Judge Doom, and even a Klingon. Anjelica Houston on the other hand had the look of Morticia, but her voice was at times barely audible. I did not care for grandma either as that person would thankfully be played by Karol Cane in the sequel and she did a much better job even though that role was largely ignored in both films. The story here is rather different, as we have a person trying to pass off this dude whose mother is like some loan shark or something as the long lost Uncle Fester. So we have a guy trying to make heads or tails of the strange family while trying to get the family fortune. There are some funny scenes and long dead sections to the movie as well. The kids Wednesday and Pugsley provide the biggest laugh for me though during there school play. All in all it was not a bad film, just needed a bit of work. I actually feel the sequel is a more complete film than this one, but not by much.",positive
"Stephen King's novel is a masterpiece, didn't properly appreciate it on first read but with King's style being much more familiar to me (whereas it was a bit of a shock at first) it still stands as a genuinely scary, nostalgic, at times very funny and very powerful book and one of his best. The 1990 mini-series is an uneven one, with a great first half and disappointing second half with the ending and IT's true form having notoriously poor reputations for good reasons. Absolutely loved the first 'IT' film from 2017 and consider it better than the mini-series personally.'IT Chapter 2?' Not so much. Actually did find a lot to like about it, with a lot of what was great about the first film still here, and for me it is better than has been said. The mixed reception is more than understandable but it is not as terrible as the more negative reviews say in my view. Chapter 1 is the better film, but the second film is better than the second half of the mini-series on the whole and again it is a more than admirable and brave attempt at adapting an extremely difficult and near-unfilmable book.While there is a good deal to recommend, there are some glaring problems. There are problems with the pacing here. Especially in the middle act, where it meanders due to being too flashback heavy. Some flashbacks being more interesting than others, with Ben's and Richie's being quite unnerving, Eddie's (the too long adult encounter not much better) was neither scary or memorable. The special effects are more variable this time round and suffer too from overuse. IT's true form comes off worst and is as bad, am not kidding here, as that in the mini-series which is notoriously universally panned.The defeat of IT is beyond dumb and really undermines a final act that actually started off quite powerfully despite also being a bit too drawn out. Henry Bowers is also extremely underwritten, and both has little presence when having barely any screen time and quite badly overacted. Lets not get started on his very rushed, too easy and quite stupid defeat.However, as was said before there is a lot to like. The production values mostly are terrific, not just the lighting but also the beautifully realised Derry setting, taut editing and cinematography that's both stunning and unnerving. Epileptics be warned though, there is a scene towards the end of the middle act that is heavy in strobe lighting effects. The music is haunting without being over-scored, ever since the first film it has been impossible to hear ""Oranges and Lemons"" in the same way again and that opinion has not changed. Andy Muschietti directs with suspense, potent realism, confidence and affection, while the writing (which is also remarkably true to King's style) has a great balance of hilarious comedy, touching drama and affectionate nostalgia. Richie getting the best lines.Much has been said about the film being too long, am mixed on this consensus personally. The book is huge and both the child and adult time-lines need a quite long length to do it justice, having said that the middle act definitely could have done with a trim. The story is not just a horror story, but also blends humour (mostly from Ritchie), emotion and a 'Stand By Like' like nostalgia. There are memorable moments here, the Mrs Kersh encounter, the Fortune Cookie scene and the very freaky beginning (am amazed they managed to film this scene) being standouts. There is one improvement here over the previous film, Mike is much more interesting here which was necessary as this time as an adult he is something as the glue of the group.Cannot fault the performances. All the adults are very well cast, with Bill Hader absolutely killing it as Richie, and the children are great again especially Finn Woolfhard and Sophia Lillis (the standouts in the first too). Bill Skarsgaard is again the stuff of nightmares as Pennywise, filling giant clown shoes with aplomb and putting his own spin on it. If asked who is better between Skarsgaard and the unforgettable Tim Curry, mainly because of more familiarity Curry gets the edge but they are both must sees in their own way.Summarising, not brilliant and uneven but enjoyed it on the most part. 7/10",positive
"I approached IT: CHAPTER TWO (2019) with some trepidation having heard of its poor reputation beforehand, and it turns out every bit of criticism was totally justified. Whereas the first chapter was a solid and enjoyable 8/10 for me, this sequel misses the mark in every respect and feels like it was made by a totally different team who had no idea what they were doing. It's a dragged-out, silly, and ultimately padded follow-up story that has no need to be three hours long; I thought it would just tell the adult story but it turns out we keep getting unnecessary flashbacks to the kid stuff too, which slows things down no end; as far as I'm concerned the kid story was done and dusted by the end of the first film.The book is my favourite of Stephen King's for the way it brings 1950s small town America to life but this is updated to the present so we miss all that. The cast members do their best with the characters given, but they all feel so bland here and quite interchangeable so there's no peril surrounding their predicament. I found Pennywise over exposed and a little silly, like Freddy in the NIGHTMARE sequels as they went on, and the oddly bloodless CGI scares become repetitive after a time. In the end, it just goes the way of mindless CGI action like most Hollywood stuff these days, so I'll be sticking with the 1990 miniseries methinks.",positive
"It's 27 years later. Mike still lives in Derry, Maine. He's tracking suspicious deaths and calls up the rest of the Losers' Club. Pennywise is back.I understand what the movie is trying to do. It is definitely far superior to the 1990 mini-series. It's very apparent from that 90 movie that the kids' side is the far superior part. The adult side is a real problem that this movie is trying to solve. The solution seems to be to inject as much of the teen actors as possible with the constant flashbacks. First, the Chinese restaurant is better than ever. With more artistic cuts and great creatures, that section is lots of fun. The structure is still everybody gets their own scare section which can be repetitive and not that scary. The entire movie is not scary but it is fun to revisit this world. There is a reason why the movie goes back to kids on bikes. The new adult cast is great. The kids are a little older although it is supposed to only be that later summer. It's all fine but a step down from the first movie.For the third act, there are some good, some bad, and some I'm not sure. The spider-Pennywise looks good. It couldn't get worst than the 90 spider. I really question the sacrifice of the tokens mostly due to the battery acid line being lost. There is so much potential in using the tokens as weapons against Pennywise. Beverly's postcard could be used as a shield and Pennywise would break her shield by pointing out that she doesn't even know its true origins. It's crazy that Mike didn't bring his sheep-killing gun. I don't know about Mike. He did that to the artifact and I don't know why. I don't get his problem. I do like Richie's token story. As far as big final battle, it's mostly fine and I really like the bathroom. All in all, I wonder if a whole new rewriting of the franchise wouldn't be more compelling. I would have been interesting with a whole new cast of kids doing their Scooby gang while they research the old gang. This franchise works much better with kids.",negative

The cast is impressive, with names such as Jessica Chastain and James McAvoy; the long production has great but excessive special effects; but the film is less scary that the first part. Bill Skarsgård steals the show in the role of the evil Pennywise. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""It: Capítulo Dois"" (""It: Chapter Two"")",positive
"Now there are talks about an even bigger overall cut (the second movie is almost 3 hours as it is), so I can't talk about that right now of course, but I for one am looking forward to that, if it comes to fruition. Having said that and from what I remember from the 90s ""It"", this was consistent! I liked the first chapter and I really like what they did with this one too.There may be things in the book that are still not included (some being a bit too adult or even sick from what I've heard), but this is quite extensive. And while this is quite predictable to some extent, it still manages to scare and entertain at the same time. This is not hardcore horror and I acknowledge that some may feel cheated, but if you can just watch it for what it sets out to do, you may be thoroughly entertained",positive
"I made the decision to watch the first part just prior to seeing this second chapter, as for me it's one film. I'm glad I did, it's a direct continuation.I think the ups and downs of the first film apply here. On the plus side it looks wonderful, it's slick, well produced, overall it was visually appealing. Bill Skarsgård makes a wonderful Pennywise, he's terrifying and captivating, I loved how he moved and spoke. Very well acted, I especially loved James McAvoy, clever casting.On the downside, it's the scariest, most messed to book I've ever read, that horror didn't translate well, I felt like I was watching an adventure thriller for teens at times, it had lots going on, lots of thrills, but horror? No. It was a bit formulaic, each character hot their respective item, and each was terrorised one by one, it needed more surprises, more shocks.I preferred the first part, but I think they did a good job here, I hope it's released with both chapters linked. Overall, I enjoyed very much.Chapter I 7.5/10 Chapter II 7/10",positive
"After what I thought was a brilliant first installment of ""It"" by director Andy Muschietti, I felt this follow up was somewhat anti-climactic. While the first film had some genuinely horrifying and unexpected moments, this one seemed to tread on the borders of the phantasmagorical with a make it up as you go sensibility. As adults, the members of the original 'Loser's Club' didn't appear to have the same camaraderie so much as a duty to return to Derry and battle the malevolent evil that resurfaced after twenty seven years. I did get a kick out of the Stephen King cameo, and it would have been neat if the name of his character's antique shop was called 'Needful Things'. There was also that nod to ""The Shining"" with the 'Here's Johnny' sequence played a couple of times during that frantic exchange. It probably didn't help that I had a hard time with the theater's sound system causing me to miss some of the dialog, and I probably missed some nuance with the characters. IMDb reviewers as I write this give the film a 7.0 rating compared to part one at a 7.4 which I guess is fair enough, though as I mentioned, my top rating of a '10' for 2017's ""It"" diverges somewhat more compared to this flick.",positive
"The original 2017 It was a fantastic adaptation of the Stephen King novel, much slicker than perhaps the 1990 TV-made Tim Curry movie, and it became the highest-grossing horror movie of all time. The first film ended with the words ""It Chapter One"", so naturally a sequel would follow, which also served as the conclusion to the story, directed by Andy Muschietti (Mama). Basically, in 2016 Derry, Maine, Adrian Mellon (Xavier Dolan) and his boyfriend Don Hagarty (Taylor Frey) are attacked by a group of homophobic youths. Adrian is then thrown from a bridge, suddenly Pennywise the Dancing Clown (Bill Skarsgård, Stellan's son) appears at the side of the river, Don watches helplessly as the demon kills Adrian. A grown-up Mike Hanlon (Isaiah Mustafa), now a librarian, overhears the incident on a police scanner and rushes to the scene. Mike realises that ""It"" was not defeated and has resurfaced, so he calls the other members of the Losers Club back to Derry. Bill Denbrough (James McAvoy) is a successful mystery novelist in Los Angeles and is married to a English actress Audra (Jess Weixler), Ben Hanscom (Jay Ryan), formerly overweight, is fit and a successful architect living in Nebraska, Beverly Marsh (Jessica Chastain), now Rogan, is a successful fashion designer in Chicago and endures an abusive marriage to husband Tom (Will Beinbrink), Richie Tozier (Bill Hader) a successful stand-up comic in Los Angeles, Eddie Kaspbrak (James Ransone) is a successful risk assessor living in New York City and is married to Myra (Molly Atkinson), and Stanley Uris (Andy Bean) is a firm accountant in Atlanta, Georgia and married to teacher Patty Blum (Martha Girvin). Most are amnesiac about their childhoods and disturbed by the calls but agree to return. Stanley, however, commits suicide after his call. The Losers reunite at a local restaurant and slowly begin to recover their memories, but are terrified by disturbing visions of fortune cookies coming to life or containing hideous creatures, created by It. The group is then informed of Stanley's suicide. Richie and Eddie decide to leave while Mike tells Bill about meeting a Native American tribe who showed him a vision of It arriving to Earth from the stars, and about the Ritual of Chüd, a way of destroying It once and for all. Bill and Mike convince Richie and Eddie to stay and finish what was started, reminding them of the blood oath they made as children. It is revealed that bully Henry Bowers (Nicholas Hamilton) survived the fall down the well, he was arrested by police. Since then Henry Bowers (Teach Grant) has been confined to a mental hospital, but he escapes, with the help of It, and makes his way to Derry to find and kill the Losers. For the ritual to work, each Loser must have an artefact from their past. Beverly goes to her old home and finds the love letter Ben wrote for her, though she still believes Bill wrote it. Bill goes to the storm drain where his brother Georgie (Jackson Robert Scott) was killed and recovers Georgie's paper boat before meeting a boy named Dean (Luke Roessler) who says he hears the voices of children and sees a clown. Ben goes to the town's high school and, he realises that his artefact is his old yearbook page, which Beverly was the only person to sign. Eddie goes to a pharmacy and recovers an inhaler. Richie goes to an abandoned arcade where he finds a game token. While finding these objects, it flashes back in time to see young Bill (Jaeden Martell), young Ben (Jeremy Ray Taylor), young Beverly (Sophia Lillis), young Richie (Finn Wolfhard), young Eddie (Jack Dylan Grazer), young Stanley (Wyatt Oleff) and young Mike (Chosen Jacobs). The flashbacks reveal other frightening encounters the Losers had with Pennywise and It's other guises, but also the happy memories they shared together. After escaping individual encounters with It, the Losers use a shower cap from their childhood clubhouse for Stanley and Mike finds the rock that started their fight against the Bowers gang ago. Bill realizes that It is going after Dean and rushes to a carnival to save him, but he helplessly watches Dean be devoured by It right in front of him in the hall of mirrors. Traumatised by his failure to save both Georgie and Dean, he returns to 29 Neibolt Street to murder It. Bowers attacks and wounds Eddie and Mike but is killed by Richie. The rest of the Losers head to the Neibolt house to help Bill. The group descends into a massive cavern beneath the sewers and complete the Ritual, throwing their artefacts into the fire inside an ancient ornament. This only summons It, unaffected by the ritual, It becomes a giant, spider-like form with Pennywise's head. Mike is pressured by It into revealing to the Losers that the Natives who attempted the Ritual in the past all perished. The Losers are then thrown into nightmarish scenarios while in the cavern, but they each escape. Richie is hypnotised and paralysed by It and is about to be killed, but Eddie saves him, being impaled by It in the process. The Losers regroup and realise It can be killed if they stand up to him and make him feel smaller, so they insult It over and over, making him physically shrink and weaken. When small enough, they are able to tear out It's heart and crush it, killing It once and for all. Eddie dies from his injuries despite Richie's attempts to save him. The remaining Losers are forced to escape, as the Neibolt House collapses to the ground. The remaining Losers return to the quarry where they once swam together. Beverly realises it was Ben who wrote the letter all along, they share a kiss and start a romantic relationship. Richie returns to the bridge where he had once carved his initials, alongside Eddie. Mike decides to move out of Derry to start a new life. The Losers all receive posthumous letters from Stanley, explaining that he believed he would have held them back, he believed his death would reunite them, and he knew they could defeat It if they were brave without him. Also starring Owen Teague as Patrick Hockstetter, Logan Thompson as Victor ""Vic"" Criss, Jake Sim as Reginald ""Belch"" Huggins, Peter Bogdanovich as Peter the film director, and Stephen King as the Shopkeeper. Chastain, McAvoy, Hader and the others do well as the Losers Club grown up, the young actors make a welcome return as their childhood counterparts, and of course Skarsgard steals the show as the disturbingly nasty shape-shifting clown. It recreates a few of the moments from the 1990 version, the special effects are fantastic at bringing the sinister demonic images to life, I agree the ending is maybe not as dramatic as it could have been, and some complain it is too long, at almost three hours. But it uses its time well, like the first film you feel for the characters, and it draws you in, a most enjoyable supernatural horror. Very good!",positive
"The otherworldly creature that terrorises the Maine town of Derry every twenty-seven years is back, reuniting the now grown-up members of the Loser's Club, who swore to try and defeat the evil once and for all should it return.Chapter two of IT is, unsurprisingly, very similar to part one: effectively creepy, occasionally gory, and slickly directed, with excellent performances from both the young actors from the first film (who appear in flashbacks) and their adult counterparts. Also putting in another superb turn is Bill Skarsgård, who returns as the monster's quasi-human form, scary clown Pennywise: he's just the right mixture of unsettling and humorous. Hell, even Stephen King delivers a decent cameo as the owner of an antiques shop (the mega-wealthy author making a funny about writers being rich).Despite numerous attempts by director Andy Muschietti, I can honestly say I didn't jump once (I've seen more than enough horror movies to not fall for the obvious scare tactics), but I was suitably impressed by the inventive designs of IT's many forms, from the creepy old naked lady to the disembodied spider-head (a nice homage to John Carpenter's The Thing) to the final massive monster. Besides, the lack of genuine frights is more than made up for by the comedy, which was great throughout, with Bill Hader as Richie being particularly amusing, the best scene involving three doors and a very cute dog.At 169 minutes, I can imagine that the film will be a touch on the long side for many, but I found that it whipped by with nary a dull moment and kept me entertained throughout, which is more than I can say for some of the much shorter, more recent and more lauded horror movies of the past couple of years (Us and Halloween, to name but two).",positive
"I watched this at home on BluRay from my public library. It is disheartening that script writers choose to add so much filthy language, not just occasionally but all the way through the movie. It is at best a distraction, at worst ruins the viewing experience for many people. It is unnecessary and just represents lazy writing.I watched the first movie, ""It"", almost two years ago. It was set in 1989 and the kids were generally around 13 during filming. They used the same kids for this movie, filmed two years later, so they were generally around 15-ish.In this story it is 27 years later, 2016, and Pennywise has made his appearance again. The kids are all grown up now, all 40-ish, and scattered around the country, mostly not keeping in touch. Until Mike, who still lives in Derry (fictional Maine town), contacts them and tells each they must return. They had made a pact back in 1989, if Pennywise indeed did show up again the only way to eradicate him would be the participation of all of them.I actually enjoyed the dual time period and the dual sets of actors. At appropriate times the story switches to 1989, at other times to 2016 and is done in an interesting way. Rather than dwell on the horror that the movie includes, and there is lots of it, I mostly focused on the relationships between the old pals and at times the townspeople, comparing what was going on among them in 1989 vs 2016. Even Stephen King himself has a role, as a shopkeeper of old items, one of the grown boys finds his old bike there and buys it.Yes it is long at almost 3 hours, but except for the pervasive and unnecessary filthy language, I enjoyed the movie.",positive
"In comparison to the first chapter of this remake, then the 2019 ""It: Chapter Two"" was just a massive step back in the wrong direction.Why? Well, first of all, Pennywise wasn't scary at all. In fact, it was progressively getting more and more difficult to take him serious as an embodiment of evil as the movie progressed, because he was just too goofy. And whereas he was genuinely disturbing in the first chapter, the clown was just loosing it in chapter two.And running at close to three hours, ""It: Chapter Two"" was just too long, and too much of a drag to sit through, especially when so much of the contents just felt like it was there to fill in the movie and add to the play time of the movie. There were so many things that could easily have been trimmed away without the storyline suffering.The CGI was good, and definitely carried the movie a long way. But some of the CGI such as the long-limbed old woman chasing Beverly was just too comical and didn't really feel like it fit into the movie.It was nice that they actually had Stephen King himself in the movie for a short cameo.They had a good selection of casted actors and actresses to perform in the movie as the adult versions of the children that Pennywise stalked and fought. It was really nice to see James McAvoy in the movie.All in all, this wasn't really a fulfilling conclusion of the first chapter, and I was left with a feeling of 'was that really it?' when the movie ended. The movie was not as intense and interesting as the 2017 ""It: Chapter One"" movie was.I am rating ""It: Chapter Two"" six out of ten stars.",negative
"The film has many scary elements, and is effective in deliverying scars. However, the ending is a little contrived. I liked Part 1 better.",negative
"I watched the two films in a double bill and I really did want to enjoy this as much as I did the first - but boy, could this have been much more of a let down? The original has a far better cast; snappier direction and a much tighter script. This just rumbles along with a staccato, portmanteau-style storyline that robs the narrative of much of the cohesion of it's earlier iteration. The ending is straight out of ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" without the roller skates!. Sadly disappointing.",negative
"I was definitely hiding behind my jacket for most of the movie. The scares are for sure there, and the pennywise make up and acting are spot on. The storyline plays out well, and I enjoyed the transitions from the adults to children. The ending is a bit weird and doesn't always make sense. But I would consider the scare level on par and the storyline well developed.",positive

Director Andy Muschietti and screenwriter Gary Dauberman reteam to deliver the shivery goods if it is a tad padded (nearly 3 hours long) with the young cast as well and their older alter egos (all well served overall).",positive
"6 of the 7 members of the Losers Club which defeated It have left Derry and, in the course of 27, have found success but forgotten their childhood trauma. Mike Hanlon remained behind however, and when the child murders start up again, he contacts his old friends to remind them of the blood vow they made when they were kids.Part 1, which told the story of the kids getting together and defeating It (as manifested in the form of creepy Pennywise the clown) was very successful, Chapter 2 completes the story. The climax takes some liberties with the book. To be frank, I found the climax of the book to be somewhat lacking, and the film recognises this criticism and has some fun with hit with, one assumes, Stephen King's approval, given that he cameos in the film.That's about it, really. The cast are moderate adult representations of their younger incarnations (Bill Hader is wonderful as Richie Tozier), there is a surprising amount of humour, the kids also appear (digitally de-aged) and the film incarnation of monster-It as appreciably better than the book or TV miniseries version.Watching both movies will consume 5 hours of your life, so plan carefully.",positive
"Having found the first IT (2017-also reviewed) to be fantastic when I caught it on disc,I was happy when a friend told me a IT double bill was taking place at cinema. Finding the first to be even better than I remembered,I got set for the second chapter.View on the film:The lone person to return from the writers club of part one, the loss of Chase Palmer and Cary Joji Fukunaga is one greatly felt in Gary Dauberman's adaptation of the second half of the novel,, where once each member of the Losers Club was given a progression in their character arc of defeating their fears and a growth in maturity, is here replaced by Dauberman with keeping them all largely in one place, (with only Richie being given the sliver of change.)This is most notable in the poor writing treatment of Beverly,whose suffering of parental/spouse abuse is revealed to leave her with deep scars, none of which leads to a cathartic release that the films had appeared to be building towards. Staying true to the opening of the adult time-line in the novel with a horrific homophobic attack from thugs, Dauberman begins a recurrent theme of presenting what should be major events in the Losers Clubs lives,only to leave them hanging,from the opening attack, to Bill trying to save a child who gets killed by Pennywise, leading to Bill crying for five minutes, only to completely move on and no hint of the psychological effect it has had on him being offered. Bringing a new Comedy element into the tale, for the first hour Dauberman actually makes it work, via the sarcastic jokes they share actually establishing the bonds the adult Losers Club share, which builds to a Chinese meal reunion set-piece (the highlight of the film) that balances laughs with Pennywise shocks.Digging ""going underground"" (both physical & mentally) as being the main theme of the title, Dauberman shovels up the suppressed memories of the Losers Club,and buries the film. Going into long individual flashbacks,Dauberman takes them to a repetitive dead-end,due to Pennywise clearly not being a threat in the sequences due to it being flashbacks,and all of them going round in circles which instead of adding depth to the characters, lands on miss-placed gags.Running a gag across the film that people hate the ending,Dauberman ends the adult time line in the Losers Club epic fight on a hollow note, because of a failure by Dauberman to build arcs underground, but incredibly,at the last minute finds the spirit of the first IT,and delivers a touchingly poetic quality to the fading childhood days of the Losers Club.Craning down to the Losers Club on their bikes, returning director Andy Muschietti displays in his close working with cinematographer Checco Varese, (replacing Chan-wook Park's regular cinematographer, the far superior Chung-hoon Chung,who did IT 1) a striking skilfulness in capturing a fading memory of childhood summer days atmosphere, spinning on long crane/panning shots of the Loser Club kids cycling down the sun-lit streets of Derry.Continuing a motif first drawn in Mama, (2013-also reviewed) Muschietti links the chapters with excellent, highly-stylised transition shots/ overlapping images,turning the pages to the unresolved childhood traumas overlapping in the adult lives of the Losers Club,and in the two stand-out jump-scares, (in a house of mirrors and at a sports game) Muschietti offers a glimpse of using shadows in making Pennywise an imposing figure.Making a drastic change from the first, Muschietti places most of the jump-scares to take place in daylight,which without the aide of the gloomy lighting from part 1, in the cold light of day look shockingly poor, amateur hour,flat CGI creations. Going underground for the final, Muschietti and Varesecharge at the End of Level Boss the films have been building towards, and ruins it all by covering the entire 40 minute set-piece in strobe lighting which jabs the viewer in the eyes,and makes it almost un-watchable.When not masked in a overload of naff CGI, Bill Skarsgård makes a chilling return as the animalistic Pennywise, whilst Bill Hader gives the stand out performance in the Losers Club as Richie,thanks to Hader using his comedic skill of giving out dead-pan one-liners,to actually build a character arc for Richie,with Hader capturing Richie's gradual fear that they are all about to write their final chapter in life.",positive
"Returning to their home-town, the now-adult group of friends finds they've been gathered to fulfill the childhood promise that the killer clown Pennywise has returned and is on the loose in the town, forcing them to put aside their past traumas to defeat the malevolent being once and for all.This was a woefully underwhelming and overblown effort. Among its many flaws is the most obvious issue in that there's just no reason for the running time to last this long at all. So much of this one could've been cut down or outright removed, from the introduction of the gang one-by-one to see where their lives are like now that goes into plenty of detail that could've been accomplished easier, to the incidents in the asylum tormenting the residents inside or just the seemingly endless scenes depicting the escaped inmate under the clown's influence. That these are done in conjunction with utterly boring flashbacks and storytelling that shows how they used to be as kids that just go on forever, serve no purpose to the storyline at all and just seem to focus on seemingly random incidents that just plain dull to get through. It highlights the fact that the main clown does absolutely nothing here with so little screen-time as we're focusing on the kids' flashbacks interacting with the clown or building the romance angle instead of in modern times. The other factor to lower this one are the entirely overblown scare attempts that fall completely flat. The CGI here manages to undo so much of the attempts that the scenes of the food coming to life in the Chinese restaurant is laughably inept with the black pool looking like a deformed blob-like mess that's incredibly cheesy looking and makes no sense in the storyline how that works, much less comes off like any other expected outcome from the very start. Likewise, flashbacks to show the kids interacting with Pennywise, featuring the confrontation in the apartment, the statue coming to life in the park or the appearance from the sewer grate are all laughably bad and underwhelming with how crude they are. It's pretty disheartening to see so much wasted time in a film this long feature so little chances for something to happen and then showcase such underwhelming and laughably bad work when they do appear, really undermining this one and making for a troublesome effort. There are only a few select aspects that work here. Despite generally being underwhelming, the encounter with the kid in the hall-of-mirrors at the carnival stands out as a wholly enjoyable and solid enough effort that works off the darkness of the setting, the overall creepiness of the concept in general and stellar practical effects that are usually missing from these other scenes. As well, the spirit of unity and brotherhood that they display in the finale when they band together to take on the true form of the creature in the underground sewer lair of Pennywise which is not only a great idea to see play out but has some energetic albeit comically over-the-top action that at least puts some life into things. Combined with the creepiness of the main clown and the ability to kill off kids with graphic results, these are all that work for this one.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, underage smoking and continuous violence against children.",negative
"So close after part one already a next step into the story. But people said it's better then part one but clocking in at 3 hours I was wondering if it could deliver.It (no pun intended) did here and there. Some scenes were too long, especially when we have throwbacks to explain stuff. That's okay if yoy haven't seen the first one but not needed if you have seen it. Some humor thrown in here and there surely adds towards the rating of It chapter Two.But still, it's a horror. And it's in that region that it's better than the first one. Full of jump moments and some really well done effects. Even so good that you started to forget Pennywise himself. But when he comes in he surely brings in the horror. The end is a bit the same of sigh the forst one, same house, same things to destroy him.Is it all that good, not all. Nope, what the hell with the killing of the child in the beginning. Nothing happens afterwards with her story. Still, I enjoyed it but a bit too long as said before. Gore 1/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0,5/5",positive
"It Chapter Two is lacking. Many cliche here for an audience here: Gay couple which gets beat up by town toughs. (there is always the town tough angle) The black family burned out years ago ( there is always a bad town secret) The old tribal ritual which will get rid of the creature. ( there is always some ancient ritual. How and why it works is never explained) Well It Chapter Two becomes a formulated movie, which turns into story about childhood PTSD, and bad dreams. Every past memory must have the chasing dream sequence. Yet another cliche, which turns into another C G I fest. We never find out what, why of the clown, and or the history behind it. The remake is different from the book and other movies. The end is like a therapy session of shrinking down bad feelings and memories. Nothing about the clown, and more about the characters growing up and past. The first movie was what the second was not. Maybe the joke about not knowing how to finish a story is a joke about the movie. Maybe the break between part one and two made the story lacking. Well 3 stars there is something just lacking.",positive
"Pennywise, probably one if not the most recognizable clown ever seen on a big screen. Stephen King's character scared so many people almost everybody knows him. I enjoyed the book, I enjoyed the television mini-series, as well as the the first It on big screen. It Chapter Two is even better to me, and apparently after reading some reviews I must be one of the only ones. I don't get what people expected from this sequel. To me it was spot on, with a great cast, good CGI's, and a story that is never boring and that while the movie is almost three hours long. For a movie that long to not getting bored is already quite an accomplishment. It's one of those horror movies I will watch again, not really for the scary moments as clowns are just not scary to me, but just to watch my wife who has a serious case of coulrophobia.",positive
"... but not much else. I may be tired of all the sequels and remakes and prequels and all this regurgitated crap. I mean, we all knew how the story was going to unfold, even if the ending is slightly different and now Maturin is an Native American drug root and Pennywise sprouting spider legs prompts a The Thing reenactment.My point is that the first film was always the better one, even in other adaptations. The children's fear is huge because they are children and their courage is so much more important. Pennywise was barely articulate in the first film, now he is talking and having agents that do his bidding. The rules have changed dramatically. It's not a creature that devours every 27 years, it's one that is rebooted every 27 years. In the first film they were all friends, in this they are adults that have not seen each other in decades. How am I going to feel anything for them, regardless of the quality of the acting?Bottom line: the experience has to be different for people who don't remember the Tim Curry version or that have not read the book. Perhaps waiting a few years and then watching both films back to back offers a different enjoyment level. For me, it was just a better version of something that had already been done and brought nothing new to the table. It was scarier, but somehow it felt less meaningful. And yeah, the ending was always going to suck.",positive
"For 27 years, I dreamt of you. I craved you... I've missed you! Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard)It Chapter Two, set in quaint and vulnerable Derry, Maine, is one crowded horror film. And that's saying something as it is the sequel to the already revered It by Stephen King. It has enough horror tropes such as jump scares, surprises, and toothy, reptilian monsters to keep the almost three hours humming.However, enough is enough. After twenty-seven years from their introduction to the scary Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard), the Losers Club must return to face the horrific clown, and they hope, destroy It. Fortunately screenwriter Gary Dauberman and director Andy Muschietti include enough allegorical heft to keep this horror rampage from being just a visually hot mess.That the club must individually shed its fears and weaknesses to defeat the clown is both a strength and a weakness: strong because allegorically we all have to do this purging to be mentally healthy, and weak because isolating the club members weakens understanding of their development relative to each other and their consuming past. In other words, they are better at self-reflection facing each other, and therefore their past, than going it alone.Only too obvious is the film's attempt to show how some memories, not always favored ones, linger for decades, powerful enough to draw the initial gang back to end the reign of the ghoulish clown. At various times a magnificent seven of them crowd the screen with their long-suffering hang ups such as cowardice and guilt, all in need of purgation.King's Carrie and Pet Sematary, two of my favs, are careful to keep the protagonists to a minimum whereas It Chapter Two weighs It down with minimal but provocative leitmotifs, e.g., Beverly's (Jessica Chastain) abusive father or Bill's (James McAvoy) relationship with his deceased brother. Any one of these concepts could be fleshed out at the expense of more trifling ones.As in many action films, even with super heroes, the now commonplace theme of being who you are with courage gets overused as it does here. Compounding the sense of having seen it before are numerous monstrous visions, with sharp teeth and tentacled arms and legs for just a few of the stock monsters. Granted these are all manifestations of Pennywise's ability to shape shift and the writers to locate character flaws in the characters.It Chapter Two may suffer from trying too much, but, hey, that's better than not at all. For Steven King devotees, this is nectar; for the rest, this is a long fun-house ride with allegory supplying the fuel. Of course, IT reminds that keeping and nurturing friendships is the surest way to send out the clowns.",negative
"So here we have it, AVENGERS: ENDGAME, the expansive sequel to not only AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR but also to the whole last 13 years or so of Marvel cinema. It's a film that had big boots to fill but the good news is that it's a complete success and every bit as enjoyable as its predecessor. At three hours I wasn't sure about the pacing, but even during the slower first half the viewer's interest remains piqued thanks to the witty dialogue and huge cast of well-established characters doing their thing.The time travel plot might seem a cop out to some, but I really enjoyed the way it gives characters a chance to revisit earlier productions (and even allow the likes of Robert Redford to show up in clever cameos). The climactic action is well worth the wait and bests the battles in LORD OF THE RINGS: RETURN OF THE KING in terms of pure CGI spectacle; it only took them 16 years to get it right. Great fun, anyway, and one for the ages.",positive
"Hawkeye loses his family with the snap. Tony Stark and Nebula are stranded in space. They are rescued by Captain Marvel. What remains of the Avengers set off to confront Thanos only to find that he had already destroyed the Stones. Five years later, Scott Lang escapes from the quantum realm. He is shocked by the new world order and comes up with an idea to save everyone, a Time Heist.This is the 22nd film in the MCU. The best aspect is that it pulls together the whole series of movies and fulfill many of their emotional storylines. Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Ant-Man, and Nebula all get some powerful personal stories. Thor is doing a funny ""The Dude"" Lebowski. Iron Man is his family. Captain America finally gets his love. Hawkeye becomes vengeance. There are some other aspects that I would alter with the Infinity Gauntlet.For Ant-Man, Paul Rudd's comedic takes diminishes his pain from losing Hope. He's not quite as broken as Hawkeye. His lost keeps conflicting with his humor. Black Widow's fight with Hawkeye lasts too long. Sometimes, less is more and doing fewer reversals would add power to each turn. Nebula's final confrontation with herself needs some better work. She needs to have a talk with herself or do an Indiana Jones and shot right away. She could give a punchline like ""I don't like how she looks"". The movie yadayada a lot about time travel. The only explanation is that it's not any of those movies. It's a funny line but it's basically saying that it has no rules. Then the characters say that there are rules. I don't begrudge the MCU for yadayadaing the rules because that could get real complicate. Finally, this MCU ends like many MCU movies, with a chaotic massive final battle. I'd prefer cutting that back and the female Avengers assemble is a little too convenient. Just have two other women. That's enough. It becomes fan service. Overall, the emotional resolutions are great. The recalls to the other movies are satisfying. The story works for the most part. In a franchise that is sure to keep going to infinity, this is a great rest stop to say a few goodbyes.",positive
"Avengers: Endgame is a new American movie from 2019 and well do I really need to say a lot about the basics here? Maybe only a little bit as absolutely everybody should know by now who the Avengers are. I believe it is essential that you have seen the previous Avengers movie from 2018 in order to appreciate this one here. But you don't need to have seen everything before that from the Avengers universe by any means in order to understand this one here. Directors Russo and Russo are back and they also got their screen writers on board again here, but this is really not a surprise and accurate as this is basically a duology. Also despite the ending from the previous Avengers film, all the actors are back and with that I really do mean ""all"", even some that did not show up in the last Avengers movie, but in previous films from the universe. Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer would be the best example, even if all of these really only have very brief screen time. And what was with that Robert Redford inclusion? Now that did feel a bit bizarre.Anyway, in this 3-hour(!) film the remaining Avengers are faced with the big challenge to find a way to turn things right again and when the option of time travel arises, this seems to be their only chance. Sadly, Thanos, the titan and main antagonist, who managed to erase half the universe in the previous film, finds out about the remaining Avengers' plans. It will be a tough battle. But one when there are new heroes on the horizon offering hope such as Captain Marvel Carol Danvers who just got her own movie not too long ago. That one featured a great deal of Samuel L. Jackson, who is almost unseen in this one here. But I mentioned Thanos already and would like to say a few more words about him now. I really loved him in the 2018 film, but in this one here, he was a bit underwhelming. I understand he is weakened because he destroyed the stones not too long ago and also does not really care too much because his mission is complete, but still the way we see him basically fight all Avengers at the very same time in the previous movie and here Captain Marvel alone can almost keep him under control at his neck. Or Thor out of nowhere severes his head. It just felt a bit too easy for me honestly. Now that I mentioned Thor here, he is in it pretty much for the comedy only this time as he has turned into quite a bum over the years when everybody is clueless how to bring the lost souls and friends back. And there are many other comedy-themed moments in here. You will laugh, but you will also be sad on some occasions. I will go into further detail about that statement in the next paragraph, so if you want to avoid in-depth spoilers, then now is the time to stop reading.I personally was more shocked by the death of Black Widow than by the death of Iron Man, perhaps because I have never been a huge RDJ fan in this franchise, even if I don't mind him either. And well, Scar-Jo plays in some films I quite adore, so it was sad to see her go, also because the build-up was very strong and you never knew if it was her or Jeremy Renner's character who would die. I like him too, so a loss-loss for me. Oh well I read Black Widow will get her own film soon, so I am curious how that turns out. 100% I'm gonna watch it. And at the end, when we find out about Captain America's personal decision how to spend the rest of his life, it was a bit sad and touching too, even if I think I read that Evans is finished with the franchise after this film. We'll see how his replacement does. I have a bit of a feeling by now they are really trying too hard to get African American actors in here for the sake of it. But maybe he can prove me wrong and he is actually good. Another scene I did not like very much was the female-power-centered one when we see virtually all female characters line up all of a sudden. That did feel cringeworthy and just for the sake of pleasing liberal Hollywood. But yeah, there were many really good moments that quickly make me forget about these, so it is all good. There were great moments without a doubt and I think the Avengers universe keeps going in style. But you should not expect this film to be as good as the last. I think it stays lower quality-wise. Stan Lee's final brief cameo was also rather underwhelming. May he rest in peace.Okay finally, the closing credits were kinda special this time because we also see the protagonists in a unique way and do not get the usual epilogue scene with indications to the next movie, but it makes sense as of course there is definite closure in this movie here and the Russos most likely won't return or if they will, they have no ideas yet what will come up next. It must be special to top Thanos and these two films for sure though. But yeah, the universe is restored, half of the civilization erased is back and Thanos is defeated, so time to take a breath for a little while. And pay attention to how it is those who survived the cleansing (Black Widow, Iron Man and Captain America) who are eventually those who can be called fallen, well CA only to some extent. I think it is not necessary to give you a recommendation here as you probably know very well how much you like superhero films. The one thing I think is essential though is that you must absolutely watch the 2018 film before seeing this one and then you can decide for yourself if you want to sit through another 3 hours on the subject or accept evil being victorious. Make the right choice for yourself. I give Avengers: Endgame a thumbs-up, but not a too enthusiastic one as before.",positive
"The 22nd film in Marvel Cinema Universe has an end of term feel about it. This shows with the lack of post credit scenes.With the population of the universe halved, Thanos has completed his task.The remainder of Earth superheroes try to retrieve the Infinity Gauntlet but Thanos destroyed it.It is the appearance of Ant Man who escapes from the Quantum Realm and shows up on Earth after five years that leads to a plan and it involves a Time Heist.What is left of the team go back to different time zones and different parts of the universe to collect the infinity gems. This means re-enacting scenes from previous Marvel films such as Captain America 2: The Winter Soldier. It leads to a moment where Robert Downey Jr, Tom Hiddleston, Chris Hemsworth all vie to be in the same shot with a particular superstar actor who supposedly called time on his acting career last year.It is a big spectacle, there is a major battle that comes across as flat when it needed to be better choreographed. There are some emotional scenes with some characters among the fallen.However this is one long movie. It needed to cut at least 45 minutes from its running time. The time travel elements might make sense in comics but not here. At one point, I thought the Russo Brothers were going to outdo Peter Jackson by dragging the film's ending on and on.",positive
"Much like I did for Infinity War, I was caught up a little bit on the hype, but mostly I think I prioritized seeing this so that I could browse Reddit again, since so many popular posts are memes from the final two Avengers films. Unsurprisingly perhaps, I found that it was very much the overall picture I found with Infinity War, which is that it is far from perfect, a blockbuster pure and simple, but that it is quite a piece of work in terms of how well put together it all is.In terms of that structure, at time of writing this there are quite a few comments comparing it to the final season of Game of Thrones (which right now just has 2 episodes left) in the way that it has to bring everything together. The comparison is unfavorable, partly because GoT continues it very rushed approach to writing, but mainly because Endgame does it very well. The detail of the plotting is of course filled with holes that are best just to ignore, but the structure allows for a very nice conclusion as we retouch on moments from within the existing films, allowing nostalgia, references, and a sense of winding it up (although of course it will continue as long as the films make money). As with Infinity War, the writing somehow gives characters enough time despite there being so many of them; it hits several tones but none undercuts or takes away from another; and it mixes humor and action into a plot that takes itself seriously enough so it feels like it has weight.Of course it is still a blockbuster film, and far from perfect, but it is impressively done and very easy to enjoy if you go with what it is doing.",positive
"Minor spoilers.This is not the film I expected after the last Captain Marvel (Brie Larson). If you missed ""Ant-man and the Wasp"" that has an important tie-in. Brie Larson was in the film far less than expected. When you have so many Avengers on the screen at one time, it is hard for anyone to get a major part.After they did the Blues Brothers, we are getting the band back routine, they did a very awkward ""Back to the Future"" movie that did not work as well as planned. I expected Nebula would trick Thanos and get some stones followed by the mother of all battles led by Captain Marvel. They didn't make that film.The production had some good laugh lines and some hold back the tears moments. Not to give away too much, but it was rumored some stars didn't want to do the series anymore. They were given a Captain Kirk exit.And yes, there is, of course, the mother of all Avenger's battle which will be hard to top.Stan Lee as a driver.",positive
"Given the hype and the huge buildup to the opening of this movie, I wouldn't have expected any less of a reaction than what I find on these review boards. And to be fair, the film does encompass and bring to a finale a massive story line with a virtually complete cast of characters that form the Marvel Comics Universe. However a little bit of objectivity is in order, and the movie's current standing after three days of release (as I write this) is just a bit hard to fathom. At number five on IMDb's list of Top Rated Movies, I can only shake my head. Think of your absolutely favorite movie of all time, (unless this one is it), and ""Avengers: Endgame"" has just surpassed it. This is a pet peeve of mine and I've written about it before in my reviews, so I don't want to get carried away here. Suffice it to say that for me, any brand new release to achieve such a ranking isn't really a reflection to how good it is, but a response by the majority of fans who come to these pages to give it a top rating.So rather than being a complete killjoy, I thought the movie was good for what it was, but it took quite a stretch to bring back the characters who went missing following Infinity War. The plot utilizes the time worn (no pun intended), time travel gimmick to hurl the principal heroes back to three (or four) different pasts in order to undo the havoc created by Thanos (Josh Brolin) and his destructive use of the Infinity Stones. For once, one of the characters, can't remember who it was, stated that going into the past is really creating a new future, so that the present reality eventually becomes the past. I liked that because if you think it through, that's exactly correct. But in so doing, a whole lot gets muddled as the story progresses, and the idea that Thanos 'used the stones to destroy the stones' makes everything that follows feel like the writers making it up as they went along. Which of course, is what they did, but you know what I mean.There are a lot of huh? moments in the picture - fat Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is one - why? Thor cutting off Thanos's head another - too easy, why not any time prior? Stuff like that demeans credibility and took me out of the picture for a moment. Captain America (Chris Evans) battling himself? Doctor Strange's (Benedict Cumberbatch) circular reasoning - ""If I tell you what happens, it won't happen"". Enough stuff like this makes it all a bit muddled to follow, especially when things reach a fever pitch and the last hour descends into a gigantic free for all.But there were interesting elements in the picture. I liked what the writers did with the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), even if he didn't go into 'Smash' mode much. The fully functioning time/space GPS conjured up by Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) was kind of nifty, Elon Musk will probably start working on that any day now. I take with a few grains of salt that Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) died at the end, because, you know, no one dies in the comic book world and lives to tell about it. See, I could be a film writer too. Best of all, I'm glad the film makers got a chance to insert Stan Lee into that 1970 time line scene, because he's my favorite Marvel character, and even though he's not around any more, he'll live on as a result of all his story writing and Marvel movie appearances.In summation, by all means, see the movie, but keep things in perspective. I may see things differently after watching it a second or third time, but right now, my initial reaction is tempered with some reservation. It didn't help that there was no after credits scene, but I guess that was the point. What comes next is anybody's guess.",negative
"So, it all came to this, the Marvel Cinematic Universe is the most financially and commercially successful superhero franchise for the last 12 years, and this was the conclusion to the Avengers storyline, the most anticipated, and highest-grossing movie of 2019 (it made $2 billion in 11 days, faster than Avatar, and surpassed the record of Titanic), it's the highest-grossing superhero movie of all time, directed by the Russo brothers (Welcome to Collinwood, You, Me and Dupree, Captain America: The Winter Soldier & Civil War). Basically half of all life on Earth was disintegrated by Thanos (Josh Brolin) and the Infinity Gauntlet. Carol Danvers aka Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) rescues Tony Stark aka Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and Nebula (Karen Gillan), who were stranded in space following their defeat by Thanos on Titan. They reunite with the remaining Avengers: Bruce Banner aka Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Steve Rogers aka Captain America (Chris Evans), Rocket (Bradley Cooper), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and James Rhodes aka War Machine (Don Cheadle). They plan to retake the Infinity Stones and reverse the disintegrations, they locate and confront Thanos, but find that he has destroyed the Stones, in anger Thor kills Thanos. Five years later, Scott Lang aka Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) is returned (by chance) from the quantum realm to find the world devastated and half of the population disappeared in a snap. Scott finds Hope van Dyne aka The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) and her father Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) have vanished but finds his daughter Cassie (Emma Fuhrmann) is now a teenager. Meanwhile, Rogers is attending grief counselling sessions for survivors still struggling following the wipe out, while Romanoff is at the Avengers' compound tirelessly keeping watch over both Earth and the rest of the universe with the help of Rhodes, Danvers, Okoye (Danai Gurira), Rocket, and Nebula. Lang returns to the compound; he explains that five years had only five hours for him in the quantum realm and theorises that it may be possible to build a time machine to reverse the annihilation. Stark refuses to help out of fear that he will lose his daughter Morgan (Lexi Rabe), who was born after the disintegration, but he talks with his wife Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), and does his own experiments. Banner has embraced the Hulk part of him, and melded himself and Hulk together as one, he agrees that it is possible to go back in time and steal the Infinity Stones before Thanos is able to collect them. Banner and Rocket travel to the small town of New Asgard, where Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) and the last survivors of Asgard have settled, they are shocked to Thor overwhelmed by guilt, with overgrown hair and overweight, eating junk, drinking, and playing video games with his friends Korg (Taika Waititi) and Miek, but they eventually convince him to return. Romanoff recruits Clint Barton aka Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), now a ruthless vigilante after his family was disintegrated. Initial experiments with the time machine with Lang go awry, but Stark arrives to shows them his findings to perfect it, and testing it with Barton, it is confirmed that it works. The Avengers plan which places in time to travel to where the five Infinity Stones are located. Banner, Lang, Rogers, and Stark travel to the battle of New York City in 2012 (Avengers Assemble) to retrieve the Time, Mind, and Space Stones. Banner visits the Sanctum Sanctorum and convinces the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) to give him the Time Stone. Rogers successfully retrieves the Mind Stone, after battling with himself. Stark and Lang's interference inadvertently allows Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to escape with the Space Stone. But Stark remembers the Space Stone being in S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters in 1970, he and Rogers travel back to retrieve it, Rogers sights Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), and Stark has a meaningful conversation with his father Howard (John Slattery). Rocket and Thor travel to Asgard in 2013 (Thor: The Dark World) to extract the Reality Stone from Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), while there Thor has a conversation with his mother Frigga (Rene Russo), as it is the day she will be killed, which he cannot reverse, and he retrieves his hammer Mjolnir. Nebula and Rhodes travel to Morag in 2014 (Guardians of the Galaxy) and steal the Power Stone before Peter Quill aka Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) can. Rhodes returns to the present with the Power Stone, but Nebula is unable to return, her cybernetic interface has connected with that of her past self. Through this connection, the past version of Thanos learns of his future success and the plan of the Avengers to undo it. Thanos captures Nebula and sends past Nebula to the present day disguised as her future self. Barton and Romanoff travel to Vormir in the same year and learn that the Soul Stone requires the death of a loved one, they argue which of them should sacrifice themselves, but ultimately Romanoff falls to her death, allowing Barton to obtain the Soul Stone. Reuniting in the present, the Avengers fit the five Stones into a Stark-created gauntlet. Banner volunteers himself to wield the gauntlet, reasoning that he can withstand the radiation poisoning and the immense pain brought on by using the Stones. The snap of Banner's fingers is successful, all those disintegrated are resurrected, and one of the two of the group reunite with loved ones. However, past Nebula uses the time machine to transport past Thanos and his warship to the present, he attacks the Avengers compound. Nebula convinces past Gamora (Zoe Saldana) to turn against Thanos, and kills her past self, while Stark, Rogers and Thor battle Thanos. Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) arrives with other sorcerers, the Avengers: T'Challa aka Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Peter Parker aka Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Wanda Maximoff aka Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Sam Wilson aka Falcon (Anthony Mackie), the Guardians of the Galaxy: Drax (Dave Bautista) and Groot (Vin Diesel), and the armies of Wakanda, Asgard, and the Ravagers. The fight between good and evil begins, Danvers arrives and destroys Thanos' warship, and Thanos seizes the gauntlet, but Stark maneuvers the Infinity Stones from his hand to his own, clicks his fingers, turning Thanos and his entire army into dust. Parker and Potts console Stark as he dies from radioactive overexposure to the Stones. A funeral is held for Stark, with all the Avengers, including leader Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), the Guardians of the Galaxy, Wakandans, Asgardians, and all other associated characters, attending. Barton and Wanda take solace in the fact that Romanoff and Vision did not return in the snap. Thor makes Valkyrie the Queen of Asgard, he joins the Guardians of the Galaxy to find his true purpose, free of the burden of royalty and leadership. Barton returns home to his family and Parker returns to school, where he is reunited with his best friend Ned (Jacob Batalon). Meanwhile, Rogers is tasked to go into the past to return the Infinity Stones and Thor's hammer to their original time lines, but after doing so, he chose to remain in the past to live a full life. Rogers appears before Wilson and his friend Bucky Barnes aka Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) as an old man, he passes his shield and the mantle of Captain America on to Wilson, and a flashback reveals that he finally found happiness with Peggy Carter. By the way, there is no post-credits sequence, only some sound effects. Also starring Benedict Wong as Wong, Pom Klementieff as Mantis, Letitia Wright as Shuri, Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan, Marisa Tomei as Aunt May, Angela Bassett as Ramonda, Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet Van Dyne, William Hurt as Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross, Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill, Winston Duke as M'Baku, Linda Cardellini as Laura Barton, Maximiliano Hernández as Agent Sitwell, Frank Grillo as Brock Rumlow, Ring's Hiroyuki Sanada as Akihiko, Tom Vaughan-Lawlor as Ebony Maw, James D'Arcy as Jarvis, Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce, Ross Marquand as Red Skull (Stonekeeper) and a posthumous cameo by Stan Lee as a 1970s Driver. You will almost not notice or care about the three hour running time, it is a story in three acts: the devastation of the world, time travelling to reverse it all, and the battle to save the world, the cast playing the superheroes and the villains are all great, it is the characters that really add to it all, it has good humour, it has amazing special effects, fight sequences and spectacle, and it gets you emotionally as well, a fantastic and fitting conclusion to the saga, a brilliant fantasy action adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects. Very good!",positive
"After 'the vanishing' in Infinity War, there were still a handful of superheroes left knocking about to try and restore order to the universe, but in Endgame the real hero is a rat. A lowly rodent scampers across the controls of Hank Pym's quantum machine, activating a few switches with his little ratty feet, bringing Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) back from his five-year stay in the quantum realm. And it is Lang's return that kick-starts a desperate attempt to reverse Thanos' nefarious handiwork.If you can swallow such lazy writing, then you'll no doubt have no problem with the rest of the film, which resorts to that old chestnut - time travel - with all the paradoxical problems that arise as a result. Unfortunately, I struggle to let such things slide, annoyed by rather casual approach taken by writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, whose script scampers lightly over the temporal issues like a rat over a console (I'm sorry, I just can't let that go). While the film is undeniably enjoyable as a slam bang piece of mega-budget entertainment, it isn't as flawless or as clever a denouement that one might hope for.Visually, Endgame is hard to beat and it's great to see all of the A-list stars of the past MCU movies coming together for one last effects-filled battle (it's amazing what $400,000,000 can buy), but for the culmination of a twenty-two film series, I had dearly hoped for something a bit more considered and fulfilling than a great-looking movie that is ultimately dependent on the actions of a rat (yes, it irritated me THAT much...).",negative
"My wife and I watched this movie at home on DVD from our public library, about 11 months after we similarly watched ""Infinity War"" where Thanos wanted to destroy half the universe.In fact the very first scene of this one depicts people, parts of families, just disappearing. Thanos is so powerful, and possessing all the infinity stones, would take a giant coordinated effort by all the Avengers to figure out a way to defeat him. And only some kind of time travel to secure each infinity stone would enable them to accomplish what is needed.The movie is long, very long, at just over 3 hours with the credits. We just can't watch a 3-hour movie in one sitting after steak and wine so we watched it over two consecutive nights.It is a good movie, characterizations are very good, as is the inventiveness of the story line. The least interesting to me were the CGI-full epic, frantic battles. They just became audio and video ""noise"" to me. But the hand-to-hand fighting was much better, as were the actual interactions of various characters.I don't see a listing for the next Avengers movie so is this the last one?",positive
"Well, I finally got around to watching ""Avengers: Endgame"", even though I already watched ""Spider-Man: Far from Home"", so I already knew some of the events that were to transpire in ""Avengers: Endgame"". And I am not really fond of the superhero genre, but I still watch the movies when given the chance, as they are usually visually fantastic and provide adequate entertainment. And of course with all the hype that ""Avengers: Endgame"" had gotten, of course I just had to sit down and watch it.First of all, the movie was long. A little bit too long actually. I did feel that directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo were taking their sweet time getting to the core of the storyline, and just dancing around the bushes. In my opinion, the movie did suffer from this.Visually, well let's just go with 'wow'. Yeah, the movie was phenomenally stunning to look at visually given the CGI and special effects. But of course, being a Marvel movie, then you'd have top of the line special effects. And it is the visuals that carry the superhero movies quite a long way down the road.Story-wise, then I felt that the plot and storyline portrayed in ""Avengers: Endgame"" was a little bit too predictable and too generic. You already knew the movie's outcome when you sat down to watch it. Of course, Marvel weren't going to kill off a heap of their most beloved characters. No chance of that happening. So there weren't really much of any surprises along the way. And the time traveling aspect of the movie? Seriously? That was just downright idiotic.What worked for the movie, aside from the great visuals, was the impressive ensemble of actors and actresses that made an appearance in bigger or smaller parts throughout the course of the movie. Thumbs up for that. However, I found some of the dialogue to be a bit too corny and felt that it was written for a young audience.Was ""Avengers: Endgame"" a fulfilling closure to the Marvel storyline? Hardly so. The movie, while being entertaining enough, felt a bit shallow, with parts of the story quite poorly written. But if you, like me, come to the superhero movies mostly for the special effects, then ""Avengers: Endgame"" will definitely blow you away.All in all, I am rating ""Avengers: Endgame"" a six out of ten stars.",positive
"Watching the coming attractions was depressing. No wonder kids are half brain-dead today. My only interest in anything Avengers is Benedict Cumberbatch. I thought this was a fun film, loved all the cameos and the actors are all very likable. Special effects were amazing, but for about a half hour there I felt like I was watching a video game.Thought the script managed to have some poignancy and humor as well. And you have to see it in a theater.",negative
"I haven't heard more people upset about spoilers since the Star Wars prequels, so please consider this sentence the spoiler space you very well may need if you don't want to learn more. Then again, I'm going to discuss the idea of this film more than the actual movie itself.Avengers: Endgame is the blockbuster of 2019. It's a juggernaut that has the biggest cast of any superhero film ever, wrapping up almost 12 years of storyline and multiple movies, all to answer the question that came up at the end of Avengers: Infinity War: after you kill half of everything, what happens next?There's been a lot of soapboxing and online hand wringing about this film. Plenty of people feel the need to show that they're above the paltry populace, happy to proclaim their intellectual superiority and state that comic book related films demand that adults remain stuck in the days of adolescence. Much like the issues of today's politics, I'm not going to change anyone's mind that feels that way. All that ends up is two people shouting their talking points and refusing to learn anything from one another. But my snide comment is this: can't you just leave well enough alone?This is a popcorn movie that appeals to the biggest audience ever. And that's fine. You can ignore it if you like - we've never lived in a time where there's more opportunity to enjoy the media that you want. Me, I ignore mumblecore, critic beloved films and Oscar-bait movies for the most part. And that is also fine.All that I know is that I've seen nearly every Marvel film with the same set of guys that I've seen movies with since I was 25 or so. Each movie is an event where we get the chance to grab a meal, catch up and enjoy one another's company in the midst of our exceedingly stressful and busy lives. If a movie can do that, it's already a success before you even watch one frame. Movies bring us together, a light on the cave wall where we can hear a fantastic tale that's bigger than us. That's what this movie is - modern mythology of larger than life heroes who are the best of all of us battling the worst villains possible.Spoiler warning part two - here's where I get into major plot points. You've been warned.More than the overall tale, I enjoyed the story beats here. Hawkeye becoming Ronin, enraged that evil survived the purge while his family did not. The main sacrifice of this film isn't Black Widow's, but his. He was the first person who saw her as more than a killing machine and gave her a chance at life. Now, she repays the favor, taking him from killing machine back to family man. However, he must sacrifice their friendship and the knowledge that her loss will always be in the background when measured against the perceived greater loss of Iron Man.But hey - I've always loved the background characters more than the heavy hitters.There are moments here that really portray what the three main Avengers have had to give up to protect us. Iron Man must lose the stability and family he never knew he needed. Captain America's longing for Agent Carter, trapped by a glass wall that may as well be decades and not inches thick. Thor's descent into depression as he realizes that he couldn't save the day. Their fates each show them finally achieving the final part of their hero's journey save Thor, who is fated to repeat his journey over and over throughout rebirth after rebirth, even after Ragnarok, the end of all things.Those small moments mean more than the big explosions and special effects throughout this film. Tony's quick hug with his unsuspecting father. Thor's moment with his mother, who sees right through his deceptions. Even Quill's way too brief reunion with Gamora. The heart behind each charcter is why we care. There are hundreds of superpowered characters on the screen. The fact that we know the minute motivations of more than one of them is a credit to this tale.I love that this film both wraps up and begins new stories at its close. Sam Wilson must become Captain America, finally receiving the approval and friendship of the Winter Soldier. Thor realizes that his role is to be an adventurer, not the king, and gives the ownership of Asgard to Valkyrie. Even Steve Rogers realizes that despite becoming a grief counselor and telling people to live the new life they've been given, when the opportunity arises to return to his life, it's one he should embrace.Speaking of Rogers, I haven't heard an audience start cheering in the theater for a long time. The fact that he's able to lift Mjolnir, Thor's hammer, was not lost on this audience. Before, he was able to budge it. Now, his journey has made him truly worthy to lead the forces against Thanos, even if he appears alone at the seeming conclusion of the final battle.I also like the synchronicity that the first words that kicked off the Marvel cinematic universe were Tony Stark saying, ""I am Iron Man,"" which are also his last words. There's just something poetic about that.Hey look - I was happy that Crossbones got a few seconds of screentime. I'm that kind of geek. And if that fact upsets you, I'm never going to convince you that this is a good movie.",positive

"OK So 3-Hours is Not Little Time for a Movie.But with a Universe so Vast and Varied with Characters and More Characters Interacting and Interweaving among Various Plot-Lines and Adventures,3-Hours can Barely Contain Any Kind of Finality that is Completely Satisfying.But the MCU (Marvel Comics Universe) has been Leading Audiences to this Point Through Over 20 Movies.So it had to Wrap-Up at some Point.

"Picks up after the chaos of ""Infinity War"" and tries to restore the equilibrium of the universe. This is great - Anthony Russo manages to adeptly corral some of the biggest A-listers around into a great couple of hours of entertainment. The sum of the whole is definitely greater than the parts - and they all look like they enjoyed putting the world to rights. Of course, it isn't at all cerebral, but that's not the point. This is spectacle cinema at it's finest (maybe Darth Vader is missing...) and if you're disappointed then you didn't read the label on the tin first.",positive
". . . (that is, CNN and MSNBC) have labeled our current threat to Life the USA as we've known it as Washington: Endgame, in apparent homage to AVENGERS: ENDGAME. Where these courageous news outlets may differ amongst themselves is in regard to which facets of the Armageddon-like Final Battle of the movie represent who, among the Axis of Evil's Real Life gathering of Satanic Forces. While ""R. Maddow"" on MSNBC has not been shy about pointing out that the cinema Bad Guy's Giant Flying Slug is a dead ringer for POTUS #45, CNN's ""A.

"I would be lying if I said that I wasn't a little disappointed. The Avengers: Endgame has been one of the most anticipated movies since... well since The Force Awakens but that was way back in 2015 and in this day and age that's like a million years ago. The point being: Endgame was the talk of the town since all of those beloved MCU characters faded away. Infinity War was such an epic movie what could Marvel do as an encore? Or better still, what could Marvel do to conclude the magnificent journey they took us on?If anything, Endgame proves that it's hard to write a perfect ending. Perfect endings are stuff of legend. Whether the ending has a twist, a ride off into the sunset, or a mixed bag they are hard to write and hard to execute. Endgame is supposed to be just as the title suggests: the end. This is where the Avengers wrap it all up. Endgame was one long goodbye and it seems they tried to make it as heartfelt and dramatic as possible.Infinity War started with a bang and ended with a bang. It was a fast moving roller coaster throughout. It came together so nicely with all the different characters, the different tasks, and the different battles. It was a superb blend of flavors that came together for an excellent meal. Endgame, on the other hand, was almost like a decompression. If you were huffing and puffing from Infinity War then Endgame was a chance for you to rest, catch your breath, and absorb all of what happened. It was a long slow exhale with just one last burst of energy before retiring. And it wasn't what I was expecting.Not that getting what one expects is necessary to be considered good because sometimes you can be surprised in the best way. After all, we've trusted Marvel thus far so no reason not to trust them to put the finishing touches on their masterpiece. Now that I've seen their final brush strokes and the completed work I have to say that their hand slipped a little when adding the finishing touches.Like a fireworks show or a symphony I wanted the ending to be this huge crescendo. I'm not talking simply about the last 20-30 minutes of the movie, but the entire movie. I wanted to see all of the fine Marvel characters in their finest form, or close to it, as they went for their last hurrah. I wanted them all to be like John Elway retiring after his second Super Bowl, retiring on top, not Muhammad Ali who held on too long and had a less than flattering exit from boxing. But that's not what I got.We got to see heroics, of course it's a superhero film, but it was so subdued. The entire tone of the movie was muted. It was a somber morose three hours. The humor wasn't as humorous. The fighting was somehow less awesome. Everything was just darker and more lifeless. Even the hero moments which were supposed to evoke the most joy, awe, and righteous triumph didn't quite do it. Now it could be because it was 12 a.m. by the time the movie wrapped up and I was tired but I don't think that was it. Many a movie has revived me due to it's captivation. End Game didn't revive me or stir me in the way I thought it should. If anything, they put me to rest along with the Avengers saga. I was going for a conclusion, yes, but I also wanted reinvigoration and revival. Sadly, I got solemn and subdue",negative
"Greetings again from the darkness. In what was originally titled ""Avengers: Infinity War Part 2"", we get the much-anticipated conclusion to the most recent 22 Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films ... specifically Phase 3. Regardless if you are a deep-rooted fanboy or a casual viewer, you likely know the questions heading into this finale:Can the Avengers defeat Thanos? What role will Captain Marvel (and her pixie haircut) play? Will those who died in AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR be brought back to life? Will Tony Stark/Iron Man make it back from drifting in space? Who will survive this final battle?We knew this one had to be big, and in fact, it's colossal/humongous/monumental ... whatever your preferred adjective might be. And you can rest easy knowing that all of the above questions are answered quite clearly in this 3 hour epic from co-director brothers Anthony Russo and Joe Russo and co-writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (the same directors and writers behind AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR and a few other MCU entries).Marvel has excelled over the past decade plus by combining interesting characters, understandable story lines, visually stunning effects, and clever humor. This finale offers all of that and more. In fact, it's difficult to imagine a more perfect ending to this galactic odyssey ... and I don't offer that praise lightly. From the use of Traffic's classic ""Dear Mr. Fantasy"" and a gut-wrenching opening scene that yanks us right back into that feeling of dread provided by 'Infinity War', we know we are in for a ride that is quite a bit more somber and even more emotional than what we've come to expect.The fallout from the Thanos snap is clear as we catch up with Black Widow, Captain America, Thor and Hulk. Each is dealing on their own terms, and while the Banner-Hulk merger is quite something to behold, trust me when I say, you've never imagined seeing Thor in his current state. This marks Chris Evans' 10th film as Captain America, and he is front and center through much of the film - as is, in a bit of a surprise, Karen Gillan as Nebula. It makes sense given her tie to Thanos, and Ms. Gillan holds up quite well in the spotlight.Since the previous and speculation has been on time travel and the Quantum Realm, brace yourself for a bit of convoluted talk about how that works, but that's the closest thing to a negative I have to offer - and even that is offset by numerous punchlines at the expense of BACK TO THE FUTURE and most every other time travel movie ever made.The theatre was packed with Dallas area critics and industry folks, and there was a significant amount of cheering, applauding and more than a few sniffles. Yes, this one will take you on an emotional journey as well as a visual one. It has a tough/emotional beginning and a tough/emotional ending. These are characters we've gotten to know over multiple films ... and you should know just about every major or mid-major character from every Marvel film makes an appearance, as do numerous minor ones. It's quite a remarkable reunion. And yes, the brilliance of Tilda Swinton as The Ancient One more than offsets the Pepper Potts scenes.Creator Stan Lee does get his final posthumous cameo (good for more applause), and there is a 'women's movement' moment that seems to be Marvel's ""we hear you"" statement. Much of what we see is ""inevitable"", but as the Avengers assemble this last time, we are there to laugh, cry and gasp. This is what happens when 'over-the-top' is 'just right'.",positive
"Tessa Young (Josephine Langford) is a good girl. She is starting college and her simpleton boyfriend is still in high school. Her mother (Selma Blair) hates her new roommates. She is pulled into their party world and the mysterious bad boy Hardin Scott (Hero Fiennes Tiffin).Langford is a beautiful girl but I would give her glasses to fit the role. Hardin is such a smirking British douche that it's impossible to root for this relationship. It's cringe-worthy how much I dread this movie going forward. The only meet-cute moment comes from the Great Gatsby difference. He needs to dial down the hipster vibe and dial up the bad boy personality. Her high school boyfriend isn't much better either and bookish Landon has no juice. Dread is the defining word for this movie. I'm guessing that this is 50 Shades for teen girls. It's just as bad. The plot is slower than molasses and obvious as F. The dialogue is clunkier than a Ford Pinto but this movie has no possibility of exploding. The breakdown of Jane Austen is simplistic and too broad while trying to be deeply literary. That's part of the clunky dialogue conundrum. It needs to be smart and it tries to absorb the smarts by commandeering literary classics. It fails the comparison. It would be smarter to debate the romantic possibilities of Fuller House. At least, it would be at its own level. With Langford and Tiffin, the movie has two models right out of a catalog. They are unable to deliver more dimensions to these characters. There are way too many montages although the aquarium looks great. This is indeed 50 Shades for teen girls.",negative
"My wife and I watched this at home on BluRay, while it contains nothing particularly novel it is a mostly well written and well acted story.A few years ago this website, IMDb, was pretty useful. Not so much now that ""reviewers"" are allowed to write one-sentence non-reviews and give a movie a ""1"" or a ""10"" rating for no good reasons. This movie is neither of those two extremes, and if you ignore the highest and lowest votes, the vast middle set of votes show it to be about a ""6"" which is appropriate when you compare it to other movies of similar themes.Already done many times, a good student goes to college only to be exposed to lots of things that surprise her, and in the process meets a boy that by all reason she should stay away from but his magnetic personality draws her in. When it is all done she sees the world in a different way, this is her ""after"" the experiences.Josephine Langford, a young and pretty Australian actress, is very good in the role. We watch, we know we have seen it all before, but it is still interesting to see where it goes. Not a superb movie but not trash either, a decent watch for those who enjoy an interesting college romance story.",positive

"Ok, so I'm not the demographic so why am I surprised that this made me squirm? ""Tessa"" (Josephine Langford) is the straight-A student who falls for dark, enigmatic bad boy ""Hardin"" (Hero Fiennes Tiffin) and they spend much of the next 100 minutes trying to get it together. Snag - well he has a rather harrowing secret that can render him unreliable and unpredictable. Some of the dialogue is so cheesy - ""I really don't deserve you"" type stuff (well, actually Jenny Gage, neither do we) - as to really make you cringe which leaves us with a slush-fest that doesn't allow either of the two principals - whom, I think, have some potential: she has something of the highly personable Reese Witherspoon about her and HFT is tall, handsome (not pretty) and charismatic - to make their mark on this rather plodding romance. It also uses some terribly uninspiring filming techniques to substitute for decent writing and creativity in a fashion that all too frequently resorts to the soundtrack when things start to go a bit wonky (egged on my some pretty nasty ""friends"") just when the script should be at it's most poignant! I gather a sequel is in the pipes - give the guys a chance and give their characters some depth!",negative
"Josephine Langford is quite an appealing actress prettier but less distinctive an actress than her 13 Reasons Why actress. She acts well.Hero Fiennes is a little lacking in that charismatic quality to make him a lead romantic role.The grown ups are played by some big names Selma Blair, Peter Gallagher and Jennifer Beals. More of them would have helped balance the story.The reveal is cliched and vaguely familiar. But this story feels half finished. What's happening next?",negative
"At a crucial moment in ""After,"" Tessa Hardin makes a request of Hardin Scott: ""Just go slow."" But it turns out that the two characters do the exact opposite in their whirlwind and tumultuous relationship.Based on the Anne Todd novel of the same name, which has been advertised as ""1 billion reads,"" ""After"" is self-referential film to Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice."" The Austen novel is mentioned frequently and is the subject of a class assignment of Tessa and Hardin in a university English literature course.Tessa and Hardin see themselves refracted through the lens of Fitzwilliam Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet in ""Pride and Prejudice."" But they never seem to grasp how Austen spent the entire novel in developing the courtship before Darcy and Elizabeth finally declare their love. By contrast, it is a veritable race to a full-blown, live-in relationship in ""After"" with Tessa instantly dumping her old beau Noah and moving in with Hardin. The Tessa-Hardin relationship is stormy, facilitated by the cruelty of their ""friends."" Instead of courting one another, the two characters are courting disaster.A weakness of the film is that Tessa and Hardin were students who hardly ever seemed to study. In the bonus track of the DVD, there were several deleted scenes where the students are at least seen cracking a book. But in the final film cut, the characters seem to arrive in college fully prepared and having completed all of the readings for a liberal arts curriculum. Their declared majors may be Economics or English, but their true course of study ""The Relatonship.""It is difficult to flesh out any themes from this film that primarily dramatizes the ebb-and-flow of the relationship of Tessa and Hardin. The couple seems to bond around a rough childhood in which Hardin had an absent father and Tessa was abandoned by hers. One of the most touching relationships was that of Tessa and her over-protective mother. So, the main takeaway of this film is something like ""there's no place like home"" and, above all, in matters of the heart, follow your own advice: ""Just go slow!""",positive
"Always, always a sign of cheap production/script is opening scene w/overhead view of car traveling on roadway. Furthering the formula, for our single mom's daughter being sent off to college, is the dorm scene meeting of her new roomie who of course is the polar opposite of our nice bookish daughter - duh!. Then comes the all too obvious being coaxed into a party instead of studying. Usual redux countless times scenario of alcohol, and girl meets guy which leads to problems & obvious resolution.

"Its a film with a recipie that has been used hundreds of times before, and if you feel full of the romancedrama genre then you might want to shadow away from this flick.its a college flick, where the girl leaves family and lifelong boyfriend for her collegedegrees. and as always true love is defeated by the new and exciting environment, with new boys to attract and hunger for. its a tug of war between the girl, her homeboy and homefamily, and her new handsome boyboyfriend and some rather weird fraternity environment.but things doesnt go quite as planned, as usual, and the grumpy old man found this film too longlasting and not inspiring at all. i dont think that the vast majority would behead me if i say its a bit boring at times. but mentioned must the score be, its varied and easy listening so if you dont like what you see,close them eyes and listen.its ok",negative
"After is a Drama - Romance movie in which we watch a young woman falling in love with a young man who is very complicated because of his dark past and some choices he has done. They both have to find out how they can work things out in order to be together.I did not have high expectations from this movie and that is the main reason I was not disappointed. This movie has a poor and boring plot, without any plot twists or surprises to make it even a little bit interesting and it's mainly consists of major clichés. The interpretations of the cast followed the same pattern of the plot and direction, and they were below average. Finally, I have to say that I have not read any of the books and I only take into my consideration the movie which I found dreadful and I believe that I wasted my time watching it, I do not recommend it to anyone.",negative
"After (2.5 out of 5 stars).After is a romantic drama film that follows a young teenager entering college. She was raised with tight rules by her mother and has a boyfriend from high school that is caring and respects her. Tessa (Josephine Langford) is innocent. She does not party, drink, or hang out with a bunch of guys. When her roommate introduces her to a bad boy attitude kind of guy Hardin (Hero Fiennes Tiffin). He is tattooed, does not stay in one relationship, and is rebellious against his father. She falls for him. He takes her virginity and falls for her. He does have one dark secret that she does not know about him.The romantic drama does not offer anything new to the genre. It has its clichés. Tessa is awkward and innocent. Hardin is the opposite. They bump heads with their views and despise each other. Until they both go out together and fall for each other. Tessa's mother cuts her off cause of her behavior. She loses her high school boyfriend cause of the new guy. There is something that Hardin has yet to share with her.The script is cheesy with its dialogue. The direction is slow and has an uneven pace with the film. The plot is thin. The story is about an innocent girl meeting a guy that may make her different. There was barely any story. The acting was kind of stiff with Josephine Langford and Hero Fiennes Tiffin.Being based on a teen novel, maybe the film will find its audience from the fans of the book. Others may just see the film has another typical cliché romantic drama story that should have been on a lifetime channel. Overall, After is a pretty bad film with its bad acting, boring direction, stiff script, and a plot that is lacking in a story.",negative

"Should start out by stating this is not my cup of tea. This movie is more for the teen/young adults and I'm not that target audience. It's starts out with the typical formala that all the girls would love about a good girl who falls for the bad boy. This movie does have some enhanced archetypes: the protagonist is a goodie two shows on eleven, her college roommate is met to be the very polar opposite. I mean everything about her scrams unchristian, and the bad boy seems to be just a pretty face with a British accent. But the movie starts to get better. Like the fantasy of the young teen novel seems to wear off and the story becomes very grounded and down to earth as it progresses. I think if I was a teenage women I would have not found it so dull",negative

As turnout, this film is about Tessa playing a ""Truth Or Dare"" game at a college party and the Dare ask her to kiss Hardin! Tessa rejected to play and Hardin bet with his friend that he will won the girl and dump her after! Pacing of the entire film really quite slow, a bit feeling to fall asleep to be honest!

One day, Tessa buying a coffee and Hardin ask her out, she saying let they have some distance but she agree to go with Hardin after that! Hardin take her to a lake and claim that is his favorite place! They swimming in the lake and did not kiss each other! Hardin touching Tessa on the surface but suddenly stop!

Even one night, Tessa's mother bump into her room and saw they making out on a bed, her mother ask her to leave the guy and cut off her college fund! Tessa still insist she want to live her own life! Several kissing scene and eventually Tessa say she want Hardin in a scene! But this scene suddenly stop in the middle, because the girl asking the boy to go slowly! Is that a full of passion girl doing? Ridiculous! Boring! Saw a review saying this film very intense! Really? Am I sawing a different film? After Tessa know the truth, she go back to her mother and her ex-boyfriend! I'm expecting a touching ending! But even Hardin saying he really love Tessa after the game but still not touching at all! All kinda predicted to happen! Ending still no good at all! Tessa go to a interview for internship that actually Hardin told her to apply earlier! This scene don't even tell us what the outcome! At very last, Tessa reading the so called thesis Hardin handing out to the lecturer! The thesis actually is a love letter for Tessa! They sat on the bridge on a lake and the credit roll out!

"For centuries, the search for great love has guided authors of all kinds, from Shakespeare and his Romeo and Juliet to Emily Brontë with Wuthering Heights. In the face of so much abundance, the writer Anna Todd doesn't even try to dare in After: the proposal here is to reinvent the wheel, adapting a beaten story for the present day while splashing references here and there, to support it. And this is not a demerit, such is the honesty transmitted to the viewer, even though comparisons and similarities are inevitable. The first one, wide open, is in relation to Fifty Shades of Gray. Not so much because of the spicy climate of the sexual saga created by E.L.James, but because of the conception of the female protagonist: Tessa Young - pay attention to the surname, not by chance! - it is the exact copy of Anastasia Steele, be it for behavioral naivety, angelic costume or even purified virginity. Her counterpoint is Hardin Scott, whose booklet also follows the basic stereotypes to the letter: rebellious, elusive air, an exotic beauty a la James Dean, with a hint of devourer that echoes in relation to sex.Overall, Jenny Gage's film strictly follows the formula for winning over teen audiences; however, for those who are already used to the subtext of the genre, there is not much to add by not leaving the common place and presenting uninteresting characters. Tessa is sweet, modest and responsible, the product of the firm education of an authoritarian mother. At university, she meets her roommate, Steph (played by rookie Khadijha Red Thunder), a funky party girl who turns out to be the opposite of Tessa. It is Steph who presents to the protagonist his objective for the film: the sensitive, closed, tattooed, literary lover, handsome and bad boy, Hardin (Hero Fiennes Tiffin, ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince""). The problem is that Tessa's story is so simple and sweet that any expectation of accompanying the feature with richness or depth needs to be reduced to zero if she wants to consume it with any possibility of fun. The universe of ""After"" is created from the perspective of an immature girl, who had a repressed adolescence, only that the new phase of the student remains a simplified version of a dream world, which includes the personification of an ideal boy in the role of Hardin. Everything is very shallow and reduced to stereotypes in this story and, considering its conception as ""work done by fans"", it is difficult to expect more than that.However, this success comes side by side with a controversy: the abusive relationship. Hardin and Tessa's romance is filled with controversial moments where the young man abuses the girl's psychological condition by verbally assaulting her, taking various extremely toxic actions and being quite explosive. In the film, and here is the positive point of this adaptation, it was all softened. Here, their relationship is modified so as not to have a negative impact in the same way that the books did and still do today. Hardin continues to have an explosive personality, but does not directly affect Tessa. He is very controlled, and his explosive moments happen while the girl is not around.Novels aimed at the female audience have as their elements escapism and the representation of a perfect world, without any commitment to the reality of different human types. Tessa represents that ideal point of view. Her romantic partner likes books as much as she does, she is sexy and attractive, she suffers from problems like hers, treats her gently, respecting her wishes, represents the independence she seeks and, at the same time, cares and protects her. The development of this relationship serves Tessa's pure interest, without any surprises or difficulties. Even the sacred book for fans of this genre of stories, Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"", appears as a recurring reference in ""After"" as winks for her audience saying ""this film is for us"".As a cinematographic work, the absence of risks that history takes also impacts its look. There is nothing that at least tries to get you out of mediocrity. The clichés of this format are all there: the drama in the rain, the lust of the ""wet"" characters in a lake, the narrated voice that begins and ends the film. Furthermore, even considering the target audience, it is also impossible to ignore the average performances. For such a proposal to work, the ability of the chosen couple is crucial - and at this point, there is a certain dichotomy. If Josephine Langford, in addition to exuberant beauty, shows resourcefulness when composing a Tessa that alternates between such different moments, from almost emotional closure to absolute surrender, Hero Fiennes-Tiffin has an impressive interpretive nullity. If the couple has a good time, a lot is thanks to the direction of Jenny Gage in the more ""spicy"" sequences.The weak dialogues and some unusual paths in the script. The dialogues, incidentally, instead of moving the audience, cause only involuntary laughter. It is difficult to take their romance seriously when everything seems to have been taken from the first ideas that came from the director and screenwriter. They don't try to give the story a visual pop, just like, for example, Fifty Shades did. The material is precarious, and something was needed to make the experience with the film not as tiring as possible. As much as the feature is not intended to be a reflective and profound novel, it presents some details of the narrative that are already more than saturated in the genre - such as the rejected girl who sets up a plan to separate the protagonist couple (with the right to faces and mouths when you see them passing together) and the old speech resource ""things were like this before I met you, but then everything changed"" (which I leave in the air to avoid spoilers).It is also necessary to highlight some scenes that try to create a climax without much sense - as in the sequence in which Hardi leaves Tessa alone to meet friends at Bob's after a fight, or when the protagonist stops in front of the mirror (to the sound of a version more melodic of Avril Lavigne's Complicated) and begins to put on makeup and separate clothes that are different from his style so that, in the end, it gives absolutely nothing; or in the ridiculous scene that Tessa cuts her finger on the glass. More than ten songs were used over the course of an hour and forty minutes of film. The impression that remains is that this scene only exists because they wanted a moment to highlight the music and that's it, like a video clip in the middle of the film. In order not to be cruel in the extreme, the scene involving the couple in a lake is even interesting for the direction it takes, but it does not go beyond that. The same can be said of the expected spicy scenes. Present in books, but on screen they are few and simple, missing the opportunity to create something sensual. It seems that the director was afraid of the film gaining a higher age rating, which would prevent most fans from being able to watch in theaters. It is a pity.Contrary to what marketing proclaims, After is far from the sexual fantasies and fetishes of the Fifty Shades of Gray trilogy. It is clear that the film explores the latent sensuality of two young men with the hormones on the skin, increasingly in love, but also with a good dose of puritanism. Interestingly, the same puritanism that After brings about the protagonist couple is not reflected in the subplots. If the college environment is highlighted by the sinful potential, at least from the perspective of Tessa's mother, it is also in it that the film delivers its most liberal side in addressing bisexuality without judgment. It is in this respect that the screenwriter Susan McMartin tries to capture the current young audience, setting a beaten plot in an easily recognizable reality, while fighting ingrained conservatism. The love story between Tessa and Hardin, ""daring"" in itself, has its echoes also in those around them.The proposal here is to retell the classic story of the different who fall in love, to the point of teaching each other the art of loving, facing traumas from the past and barriers of the present. This, of course, punctuating penetrating glances and the chemistry of the couple, as the subgenre booklet says. In the end, After seeks to please only fans of books. But, you run the risk of not being able to please even this audience. It is uninspired, and driven in automatic mode. A certain affection was necessary to bring the project to the cinema, but it is non-existent. Absolutely predictable, After faces the serious problem of the absence of conflict by presenting many scenes of making out between its two main actors, as if the lust portrayed compensated for the lack of history to be developed and, after all, this is exactly what After proposes: to the present day an old story about an exacerbated love, if possible making room for continuations. Demanding from him more than that is frivolous, especially for a film that, so honestly, opens up what it intends to be.",negative
"I decided to give After a re-watch since the second movie is coming out soon. And now that I've seen it again I can say, it was bland. The soundtrack was honestly the best part of the film. Plus it helped with the scenes and acting. Speaking of the acting, it wasn't too great. The romance was terrible between Tessa and Hardin. Hardin is completely toxic and not able to be redeemed. Even Tessa kind of bugged me with what she did. Overall, the movie is watchable but not many times.",negative
"I'm not a kid so I didn't read the books. Came up and I watched the trailer and it looked decent. well. I kept thinking the whole movie Tessa reminded me odf a young Reese Witherspoon and Hardin jude law. But neither possess the acting abilities. Tessa was better than Hardin whom sounded like her was reading a script which is horrific for a British actor. I thought it highly ridiculous that a female who seemed like a strong feminist would just throw away her first boyfriend and be so easily manipulated to Hardins at best mediocre attempts at wooing her. Lol. And a ton of Cliche characters to boot. They failed miserably at attempting to get me to believe any of this was real. Oh and trying to be like ""Cruel intention"" was insulting to us who were actually of age when it came out. Was it a horrible movie No but no better than a lifetime teen movie.",negative

"I was able to see ""Parasite"" a few days ago at the Philadelphia Film Festival and many people there loved the film....as did my daughter who saw it with me. As for me, I think the production values were excellent but the ending changed my overall feelings about the movie. Up untl the end, I liked it very, very much....but after the ultra-violent climax, I was left a bit cold. Your experience with the film is really dependent on whether or not you can take the violence and how it impacts you.Instead of talking about the plot and how great or not the film is, I want to focus on the violence. My daughter felt the violence wasn't that extreme and it was needed for the plot. As for me, seeing knives plunged into people at close range and seeing a giant rock smashed ultra-realistically into a person's head just turned my stomach. There could be violence without it being THIS extreme and THIS personal and close-up.So, overall it's still a good film but one I really wish I hadn't seen.",positive
"The Kim family leeches off others and lives in a basement apartment. The son Ki-woo gets a job tutoring a young girl. Using a series of lies, each member of the Kim family gets a job at the rich Park family home.I actually found the Kim family too annoying to watch at the beginning. The pizza box incident reminds me of some real life people who are impossible to work with. It's frustrating to sit through. It took a couple of tries. I prefer my grifting with better humor and better style. This family is just annoying. Pizza girl should never hire them for anything. It does get better. There is better humor and I get more in tune with the movie as it continues. I would prefer the driver to be less horny. He needs to be a complete saint. In fact, the rich family needs to be perfect at first so that they can slowly reveal their flaws. Also, they need to lay down the ghost story much earlier and sprinkle in some clues. The twist is unforeseen. That's mostly good but it would be better if the audience can suspect something like that. I do like the smell aspect. It's foreshadowed well and has a great build-up. There are scenes which I can almost smell. This is a very compelling statement about class in society.",positive
"Usually I don't read reviews before seeing a film. This one, however, I did, and happily so. First of all, it was good to know what cinema in Korea is all about. We need to shed our cultural biases, including ""how"" to make films. This had a very clever plot and an engaging group of characters. The title, I assume, means the principle figures have managed to infest a body and then use it to sustain themselves. I hope to see more from this director in the future.",positive
"Okay, so these slightly over two hours are ""Parasite"" or ""Gisaengchung"", the original title that probably nobody in Europe or the United States is really aware of. This is one of the biggest players this awards season, also in North America, and that I find really surprising. It certainly also has to do with this movie winning the prestigious Palme d'Or at Cannes earlier this year. I guess it helps that director Bong Joon-ho has worked on films with big players from Hollywood too in the past. So it is a bit of back to the roots for him now. Anyway, people have said it is a powerful statement on inequality in society and while this is a key subject in the film, I don't think it elaborates on this in a really profound or groundbreaking way or is just super creative in its explanations. It is decent, maybe good, nothing more. This is the story of a really poor family, unemployed without any real prospect that through lucky coincidence (the son's friend) manages to sneak in at a rich family's house and eventually they all have jobs there with the help of fake exam reports and the people who actually live there have no idea they are all related.You can argue to what extent it is despicable what they are doing because obviously how they remove the limo driver and the maid is really full of intrigue. Still, sometimes I struggled with how realistic it all felt. I mean that it did not. For example that the driver really gets fired or that when hiring the mother as the new maid that the rich husband and wife do not talk about who made the suggestion. And there are more moments like this. It does feel kinda fictitious at times for me, which is a bit of a negative dealbreaker for sure because like I said you can see that this film tried to make a powerful statement. It also sometimes felt too much as if they were taking the idea of a parasite and what it does as too defining like how it kills the host eventually, which is what one man does to the other near the film's end and that really did not feel realistic at all to me. Just showy and for the sake of it because even in his letter he said that he felt sorry for the man and respected him, so if he should have attacked anybody, then I'd say it should have been the guy who lived down there and went rogue before that on everybody, especially the protagonist's family. And also that the son really with all the blood literally pouring out of his head survived the attack as we find out did not feel too likely to me. It was interesting though that it was this big rock he was attacked with that clearly meant something to him as he saved it when everything was under water before that and they had to leave their real home. Karma maybe a bit because they say this big mansion is their new home.Still there are funny moments too. After all this film calls itself a satire. The highlight comedically for me was when they are all under the bed and this scene easily could have gone wrong, but it was hilarious, especially when all except the dad get out, but then the rich family's son calls his parents and he is down there on the ground in the middle of the room, but they don't see him. Don't suspect anything. But before that it is not too respectful how they talk about the man's smell. So they are definitely on the shallow side when (they think) their employees are not nearby. The escalation started really from the moment they let the old housekeeper in the house again. I also wondered why they did. I mean I can see why they opened the door, but then they should have asked what she wants and brought it to her, which of course would not have been possible, but this would have been the approach that made sense in this scenario. Okay what else can I say about this film let me think. The three younger women were all really stunning. Somebody who says Asian women are not particularly attractive should see this film and maybe he will change his mind.I have read people compare this film to Pulp Fiction, but I would not agree with that at all. The ending is as bloody as anything Pulp Fiction has to offer, but this is hardly a criterion I'd say. It felt completely different to me and also slightly inferior at least. Key subjects like religion, absolution, betting, sexual abuse and drugs are not at the center of this film here and brief talk about drugs on one or two occasions does not change that. But kinda ironic that with this comparison the director of this film is going against Tarantino at the Oscars too, even if I am pretty sure BJH is not winning. I am not sure if I like the idea of Tarantino winning the big prize this year and maybe his first Oscar for his direction, but his film is definitely way superior compared to this one here. The other contender is Scorsese and while I think his film is not too bad, I am also not won over by that one as I was by Tarantino's. Scorsese's is roughly on par with Parasite.So to sum it all up, a few more words on Parasite: It has a really nice (almost) sex scene and in general the film was working best for the comedic moments for me. The only thrilling moment in terms of drama that had me on the edge of my seat was when the former maid was walking down this long path and we had no idea what was coming. Maybe people also liked this film so much because you never knew what would happen next and if for example the family was capable of killing the two rich guys (and their kids) in order to experience wealth for years to come. They are ruthless, but are they criminals? Up to you to decide and it is all subjective. Also interesting to see their confidence rise when early on they don't do anything against the guy almost peeing right into their home, but later on they are ready to attack him. So yes, it as an interesting movie that felt shorter than it actually was, but I still must say it was not a great watch and the awards attention is just too much, also for the cast, or basically for the one guy who gets all the acting praise here (the father I think). Still go see this one, just don't go in it with great expectations. I give it a thumbs-up and I am curious to see how it fares at the Golden Globes 2020 that are just about to start five minutes from now.",positive
"Parasite became the first foreign language film to win the Best Picture Oscar. The first third of the film had me wondering why.The film opens in a dilapidated, smelly semi basement in South Korea. The Kim family is so poor that they need to borrow a neighbour's wifi and lose it when it becomes password protected. They make a living by folding cardboard pizza boxes.Dad, Ki-taek is the weak link. He cannot even fold the boxes properly so their meagre wages are deducted. Son, Ki-woo gets a stroke of fortune, when a friend helps him get a well paid tutoring job with a fake diploma. Ki-woo tutors the daughter of of the wealthy Park family who live in a lavish mansion. Soon Ki-woo gets his sister Ki-jung a job as an art tutor for the disruptive younger son.The wily Ki-jung conspires to get the Park's family chauffeur fired and have him replaced by their father. Before long they manoeuvre to get the housekeeper dismissed by preying on her allergy to peaches and be replaced by their mother Chung-sook.All of them claim to be strangers to the Park family, pretty soon the Kim's are earning good money and living well. They are street smart who have taken advantage of the naivety of the wealthy Parks.Their good fortune is threatened when one night when the Park's are away on a break, the former housekeeper returns looking for something she left behind.I thought the movie would turn out to be similar to Joseph Losey's The Servant which was scripted by Harold Pinter. It goes in that direction but then swerves off.When Bong Joon Ho accepted his best director Oscar he publicly thanked Martin Scorsese. It was his movies Bong studied in film school. The key is Scorsese's own British influences ranging from Ealing Films, Hitchcock to Powell & Pressburger.There is a parasite in the Park household but the film is about class. A fatalistic, metaphorical dark comedy which morphs into a twisted blood soaked tragedy.Parasite has a heightened reality, the Parks are wealthy who never look down even in their own house as they have no need to. They are nice but when one of them inadvertently mentions the odour of ordinary working people, like those who travel in crowded tube trains, they seal their fate.Bong shows that those in the bottom rung of South Korean society cannot advance very far. Ki-woo has a dream but it is more likely to be dashed, fate and fortune will ensure of that.",positive

"A poor family see an opportunity whenever their son starts tutoring English for a wealthy family - if they can engineer it, they can each get one of the jobs within the household. This is the basis for a film that starts out as a sort of con story, seeing the rich family as the 'marks'. As it plays out though, it keeps this assumption in the background, eating at the viewer as an idea, before then making it very relevant in the closing aspects of the plot. Between the start and then, the focus is on the various twists and turns of the drama itself. In this the film engages, and I found it easy to engage with it on the basis of what was happening.The later develops do work better though when viewed in the context of the social aspect. There are lots of clever critics that can talk to you about the meaning and hidden depths of commentary from the film; for me the key one was the falseness of the 'con' itself. Although the family mock the gullibility of the rich family, it is not like they are stealing money from them, or somehow dislodging them from their position in life - no, they are just providing labour to them in exchange of comparatively low wages. They are doing this at the expense of other working people just trying to keep a job, and the rich family could probably not care less about the 'truth' as long as their needs continue to be met. This aspect is important for the direction of the later stages of the film, and adds sense to what happens and why, but it is interesting in and of itself. Technically the film looks great, and the director builds mood and tone well. Performances are strong across all the cast, but the turn from Song Kang Ho probably was my favourite as he was the most subtle and had the most space to shift across the running time.There is a lot of talk for Oscar recognition, but it is a handsome, clever film and the timing in the year is right - I don't see it being the first foreign language film to win best picture, but this is more to do with the system than with the film. Regardless of awards or not, it is an engaging drama, with unusual developments, and built on top of an intelligent social aspect which links well to the direction of the narrative.",positive

He manages through lies to get the rest of his family hired on as the old servants are dismissed. We discover poor people have a disgusting smell to them. They smell like the subway (urine?)

"This film's ranking here on IMDb is somewhat of an anomaly. Usually, when a hot new release makes it's way into the Top 250, it manages to remain in it's general range for a while and then slowly decline as more and more reviewers add their vote. ""Parasite"" entered the list in the mid Fifties if I correctly recall, and since then has managed to improve it's position to #26 as I write this. No one knows if that will hold obviously, so I'm curious to see how the movie rates over time.Having stated that, I thought the film was brilliant in the way it opened and had the Kim family maneuver it's way into the life and home of the Park family. What was questionable to me was why the Kim's weren't able to improve their condition in life prior to the break they received when Min (Seo-joon Park) suggested the tutoring job to Ki-woo (Woo-sik Choi). Each of the Kim's demonstrated a cleverness and facility at their respective talent in such a way that none of them should have remained unemployed for very long. It's not sufficient or accurate to say that they were lazy or lacked ambition, because once that ambition kicked into gear, there was no stopping them from infiltrating into the lives of the Park's. Not that it wasn't done by underhanded or devious means, but with those kinds of street smarts, they should never have been living in a ghetto neighborhood. But that was the set up, so you have to go with it.Where the story begins to go off the rails is when the Kim's luxuriate in their new surroundings and throw caution to the wind so to speak. Personally, I would never have allowed the former housekeeper Moon-gwang (Jeong-eun Lee) unescorted access to the Park home when she came calling to rescue her husband. Though it revealed the hidden areas of the Park home, they would have been discovered by the Kim's had they followed and observed Moon-gwang to begin with. Instead, the lapse in judgment allowed for a potential escape and as it turned out, a blackmail attempt that would have fired all the Kim's from their lucrative positions.I have to admit, I was somewhat baffled by Mr. Kim's (Kang-ho Song) stabbing of Park Dong-ik (Sun-kyun Lee), but reading some of the more thoughtful reviews here helped put that into perspective. I can't say that I agree wholeheartedly, but at least the reasons offer some semblance of a motive, all revolving around the idea of 'crossing the line' that the Kim's were guilty of. Even so, by giving the story a Tarantino-esque spin for it's denouement was going more than a bit over the top. And to venture even further into the realm of unreality, Ki-woo's survival after getting smacked in the head by a twenty pound landscape stone, not once but twice!, was entirely incomprehensible to this viewer.As for the ultimate finale, who's to say that Kim-woo's plan to rescue his dad wasn't a viable one - grow up, get rich and buy the house! Good luck with that idea, because in the very words of Mr. Kim himself - """"If you make a plan, life never works out that way"". And on top of that, it would be a decade long mission at the very least. In the final analysis, if the story had kept on track with the devious infiltration into the lives of the Park's, I could envision a scenario in which the parasites might have eventually dominated their hosts in their own home. But it didn't turn out that way, and as a result, I think it misses the mark as the year's Best Picture at the Oscars.Addendum**** 2-10-2020 - Well, I'm not embarrassed to admit I was wrong about the picture's chances at the Oscars. It won 'Best Picture' last night in a pretty competitive field. Congratulations!",positive
"I heard about this South Korean a few months before its release, the title itself sounded interesting to me, but I also knew it was predicted to do very well during Awards Season, in fact, it went on make history at the Academy Awards, from Oscar winning, and BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Bong Joon-ho (The Host, Snowpiercer). Basically, the Kim family: father Ki-taek (The Host's Song Kang-ho), mother Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin), daughter Ki-jeong (Park So-dam) and son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), live in a small semi-basement apartment, have low-paying temporary jobs, and struggle to get by. Ki-woo's friend Min-hyuk (Park Seo-joon), a university student, gives the family a scholar's rock, which is meant to bring material wealth to whoever possesses it. Min-hyuk is leaving to study abroad, before leaving he suggests to Ki-woo he should take over his job as an English tutor to the wealthy Park family's daughter, Da-hye (Ji-so Jung). Ki-woo poses as a university student and is hired by the Parks; Mrs. Park (Cho Yeo-jeong) decides to call him Kevin. Subsequently, the Kim family begins to infiltrate the Park family home by recommending each other's services, posing as unrelated but sophisticated skilled workers. Ki-woo tutors and begins a romance with Da-hye. Ki-jeong poses as ""Jessica"", an art therapist for restless young son Da-song (Jung Hyeon-jun). Ki-jeong frames Mr. Park's chauffeur Yoon (Park Geun-rok) for having sex in his car, and suggests her ""uncle"" for the job, so Ki-taek, a former valet, is hired. Finally, the Parks' housekeeper Gook Moon-gwang (Lee Jung-eun) has a severe allergy to peaches, the Kims exploit this and convince Mrs. Park that she has tuberculosis, and Chung-sook takes over. When the Parks leave to go on a camping trip, the Kim family take advantage, living in the empty luxurious mansion. The former housekeeper unexpectedly returns, claiming left something in the basement. The Kims are shocked as she reveals a hidden entrance to an underground bunker, created by the famous architect and previous owner of the mansion. Moon-gwang's husband, Geun-sae (Park Myung-hoon), has been secretly living underneath the home, to hide from loan sharks, for the last four years. After realising the truth about the Kim family, Moon-gwang threatens to tell the Parks their secret if they do not, in turn, keep hers. A brawl breaks out among Moon-gwang, Geun-sae, and the Kims. They are interrupted when Mrs. Park calls, they are returning home early, the trip has been cancelled due to a rainstorm. Geun-sae is dragged back down below, while Moon-gwang is fatally wounded when pushed down the stairs. The two are trapped in the bunker, while the Kim family scramble to clean up their mess. After Chung-sook serves her dinner, Mrs. Park tells about how Da-song had a traumatic experience years ago when he saw a ""ghost"", Geun-sae, emerging from the basement. The remaining Kims hide underneath the sofa in the living room, Mr. Park complains to his wife about a smell, which is Ki-taek. The Kims, after some failed attempts and near misses, eventually manage to escape the Parks' house. Returning to their apartment, they are devastated to find it completely flooded due to the storm and are forced to sleep in a gymnasium with other people made homeless. The next day, Mrs. Park decides to host a party for Da-song's birthday. She invites Ki-jeong and Ki-woo, while Ki-taek and Chung-sook are required to be employees. During the party, Ki-woo heads down to the bunker with the scholar's rock intending to kill Geun-sae. After accidentally dropping the rock down the stairs, Geun-sae attacks him, bludgeoning him with the rock and escaping. Seeking revenge for the death of Moon-gwang, Geun-sae stabs Ki-jeong with a kitchen knife in front of the horrified guests. Da-song suffers a trauma-induced seizure upon seeing Geun-sae, and a struggle breaks out, until Chung-sook kills Geun-sae with a skewer. Ki-taek tries to help Ki-jeong, but Mr. Park orders him to drive Da-song to the hospital. In the chaos, Ki-taek takes the kitchen knife and fatally stabs Mr. Park before fleeing the scene. Weeks later, Ki-woo has survived the attack and wakes up from his coma following surgery. He and Chung-sook are convicted of fraud and put on probation, Ki-jeong is revealed to have died from her injury, and Ki-taek has vanished and is wanted for Mr. Park's murder. Geun-sae's motives for the attack are a mystery to the public. The Park family home has been sold to German family, but Ki-woo continues to scope it out. He notices the flickering light in the house and recognises it as a message in Morse code. It is a message from Ki-taek, who is now living in the bunker, which he decodes. Still living in the semi-basement apartment, Ki-woo responds to his father, vowing to one day earn enough money to buy the house, free his father, and the family will be reunited. The film's title is a double meaning, it can refer to the poor family manipulating their way into the lives of the rich family, or the rich family themselves in terms of labour, leeching off others to do to the work, it could also refer to the sinister character beneath the house. This film works well as a satirical and intricate examination of class conflict, and as a film of two halves. The sneaky set-up is a savage social commentary with an impoverished family conning their way up, and then it completely shifts gear with a darker tone and surprising moments that will get under the skin. It is the first film from South Korea to gain Oscar nominations, it became the first foreign language film in history to win the top prize at the Academy Awards (beating big contender 1917 from Sam Mendes), and the first to win Best Picture and the foreign language category together. At a time where the lack of diversity is debated, this film will hopefully pave the way for changes, it is a fantastic dark comedy thriller. It won the Oscar for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Original Screenplay for Bong Joon-ho and Jin Won Han, and Best International Feature Film (formerly Best Foreign Language Film), and it was nominated for Best Production Design, and Best Film Editing, it won the BAFTA for Best Film Not in the English Language, and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Foreign Language, and it was nominated for Best Screenplay. Very good!",positive
"A down-on-their-luck, low-class family con their way into the employ of a rich household, but events turn sinister after they find a secret in the basement.Maybe I've just seen too many really messed up movies from the far East, but at the half-way point of Parasite, which sees the discovery of a hidden bunker and an unexpected inhabitant lurking within, I hoped that matters would get seriously twisted in the way that only Asian cinema can; but while things certainly get dark, the film is not nearly as edgy, or as bizarre, or as wild as the premise suggests.The initial plot twists and turns are deftly handled by director Bong Joon-ho, there are some superbly executed scenes of tension, the performances are great, the cinematography is lovely, and the film's social commentary on how different classes view and treat each other allows for plenty of delicious satire, but the second half of the film still feels frustratingly restrained in terms of sheer audacity. Restrained, and incredibly drawn out, Bong Joon-ho letting too many scenes drag their heels, with the ending taking an eternity to arrive.In short, definitely worth a watch, but a serious contender for best picture? Surely not.",positive
"My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. I wouldn't normally be drawn to a Korean movie with English subtitles, and with a name like ""Parasite"", but because it won the Oscar recently for Best Picture, it seemed like a worthy viewing.Well we found it very worthwhile. The story is pretty novel, it focuses on a family of four, dad, mom, son, and daughter, all living in a basement of sorts in a slum area and scratching for enough money to buy food each day. Definitely a lower class existence but also seemingly bright and well educated.By good fortune the son is asked to become an English tutor for a teenage girl when his friend, the current tutor, is heading off to college. When he shows up he is fascinated by the fabulous home of this upper class family, the dad is a big executive and wealthy. The family hires a live-in maid, a driver, and tutors for the two children.Quickly the tutor sees an opportunity and eventually all four of the lower class family members cooperate in a scheme. By different approaches they will cause all the hired help to be dismissed, being replaced by the various members of their family but hiding the fact that they are in fact family members. In essence they become parasites, sucking money off the wealthy family.Of course things don't go smoothly for long, and things get really mucked up after the former maid returns to retrieve something she left in the basement. As I watched into the second half of the movie I was wondering how all this would work its way through and found the filmaker had a very interesting approach, in the very end not everything is resolved and one can decide what eventually happened.Really good movie, the dialog is pretty quick at times and you have to read subtitles pretty quickly but overall it wasn't too big of a task.",positive
"Since it won the Oscar for Best Picture, Mom and I were curious about watching this Korean film and we finally did today after I checked this out from the library. The verdict: It's interesting how the picture goes to various places concerning the poor family being employed by the rich one and then also a surprise concerning an eventual former employee of the rich family with a secret... Mom wasn't so enamored of the story because it didn't have a happy ending and I, well, I admire the way it was written, performed, and filmed but, yeah, I didn't love it. But it's a unique enough piece of work so that's something of a recommendation...",negative
"There's been some anger over this movie winning an Academy Award. It's hard for me to judge if a movie deserves to be considered the best film of the year, because the majority of movies that I love always end up being Italian end of the world movies or Mexican ripoffs of American horror tropes. Who am I to judge quality, I asked into the abyss, ignorant of the fact that I've created an entire site where I do exactly that.The idea for Parasite comes from Bong's own experience: he was a tutor for a wealthy family and imagined what it would be like to infiltrate their life. The title, which the director argued for, has a dual meaning. Sure, the poor servants are living off of the rich, but the masters are living off the labor class. They've lost the ability to clean and even move around for themselves. Everyone is a parasite in their own way.Instead of taking an existing home, the house was specially made for the film. That's because each character has a place that belongs to them and another place that is secret to them. Boon also spent considerable time storyboarding the entire film, as he believes that he must be ready for everything before the cameras start capturing footage.There's a phrase in South Korea called Hell Joseon. It means many things - unemployment, economic inequality, excessive work hours, the fact that poverty is inescapable for the lower class and that the system is rigged for the rich - but it generally means that life is hellish and hopeless.This is not a phrase that is unique to South Korea.What spoke most to me is that the history of the world - major battles and the plight of Native Americans - have been reduce to party table formations and the hobbies of disconnected children. The poor have been reduced to, at best, slave labor and at worst, ghosts. A ghost that appears to ruin the illusion that money and status seems to afford, but any man, no matter his station, can ruin and end the life of another.I've always realized that no matter how good or bad your life is, there are always people with a status above and below you. But I'll lean in and show you my hand. If there is any group that I'm prejudiced against, it's the rich. Yet it's hard to be for the family in this movie, as their machinations only prove that when they get the status they want - even for one fleeting night as they steal whiskey and a view of a yard that can never be theirs - they still hold down and destroy the lives a level beneath their own, only to then learn that their home has been flooded and taken away.There is no escape for any of the Kim family. The ways that they try to defeat the system through their attempts at grifting. But the system was built by people with far less scruples and morals. The home that promise luxury is also a prison, offering none of the comforts that Ki-taek dreams of, only a place to sneak out of at night and take his own life in his hands just to steal food.At the end of the film, I felt worry for each character and knew they were all doomed in their own way. They are all trapped, whether by death or hope or the house itself. No one gets a happy ending, even if we wished for one to come true. Is having hope in the midst of Hell Joseon worth it? I'd like to think so, even as this film doesn't.Is it the best film of the year? Is it worth the hype? Is it worth watching? I can't answer the first two questions, but definitely can say yes to the third. It takes time to get to the point when the staircase to the basement is revealed, but the movie had me from that moment.It did make me think, as all good movies should. Is everyone a parasite, unable to function alone in this world? Should a father's pride come in the way of his freedom? Should children be overindulged? How crazy is Morse code? These are the real questions I had.",positive
"This film tells the story of a family that stops at nothing to achieve what they want in life.This is a really good story that keeps me at the edge of my seat, even though there is nothing adrenaline inducing. The suspense is quite chilling, and I jus cannot wait to find out what will happen in the end. It is a sad and thought provoking story, which begs for much deep analysis and soul searching.",positive
"That's not really a home invading home topic, or in a very special way. I reminded another movie from 2013 and Netherlands called BORGMAN, very close about the topic and even more weird; try it if you can. I prefered BORGMAN, but that one if far better brilliant, bloody, ironic, cynical.",negative
"I very much enjoyed the first half of this movie. The premiss that a family of grifters manage to infiltrate a pretty vacuous wealthy family by pretending to be, initially, a qualified English teacher, then an off-the-wall art teacher; a chauffeur and finally a housekeeper is original, funny and harmless. The humorous and mischievous way the family gel with their ambitions for a better life is a testament to the excellent performances from the four the principal characters. Regrettably, however, the second half descends quite rapidly into a farcical story that drags it down. Their harmless deception takes on a far more sinister - and implausible - guise as we quite literally discover (living) bodies under the stairs. It's now almost slapstick; ultimately violent and Bong Joon Ho now just seems to have lost his way. Yeo-jeong Jo is good, too, as the wealthy wife and I would heartily highly recommend this film, but it is - in my opinion - nowhere near as good as ""Mother"".",positive
"How courteous is the Japanese He always says 'excuse it, please' He walks into his neighbour's garden And smise and says 'I beg your pardon' He bows, and grins a little grin And brings his hungry family in He grins, and bows a little bow 'So sorry, this MY garden now'.That verse by Ogden Nash, itself a satire, may well contain the nucleus of Parasite, a movie in which nothing is sacred and anything goes. I am unable to put my hand on my heart and agree with the Academy that it was the Best Picture of 2019 but I can say that it was far from the worst. Most viewers in the West, of course, were obliged to rely on subtitles to follow the story and while subtitles have never been a problem for me I always feel a slight sense of loss if a given piece of art is not written in my first language; if, for example, I am watching, say, Uncle Vanya, sitting next to a native Russian speaker, and the English translation is the finest possible I still feel that the native speaker is getting ten or twenty per cent more out of the play than I am via untranslatable nuances. So it was with Parasite but what remains is highly enjoyable.",positive
"A poor South Korean family lives in a ramshackle semi-basement apartment and gets by on hustles and cons. One day the son manages to get a job tutoring the child of a wealthy family. He sees an opportunity to get his parents and sister jobs in the household too. Soon all of them of are in and life is looking much rosier. Then fate throws them a curveball.Superb. Written and directed by Bong Joon Ho who gave us the superb crime-drama Memories of Murder plus the entertaining Snowpiercer, Parasite is a great mix of comedy and drama, pathos and social commentary.It starts off in very entertaining fashion as we meet the family that are experts in cons and manipulation. It is quite funny and initially they just seem like slackers. However, after a while it is quite awe-inspiring to see the work that goes into their deceptions.As the movie progresses it becomes darker and darker. The plot takes on a few surprising twists and turns and the two families involved become symbols of a class divide. The social commentary is thought-provoking without being preachy or seeming biased. Powerful ending.Solid performances round out an excellent plot and great direction.",positive
"Rose The Hat (Rebecca Ferguson) leads a group with monstrous appetite for young children. They eat the shine from the few special children. One of those is Dan Torrance (Ewan McGregor) who survived the Overlook Hotel with his mother. He grows up hiding his Shining. Rose recruits Snakebite Andi (Emily Alyn Lind) as the new pusher. Abra Stone (Kyliegh Curran) is a young girl with the Shining.I watched the director's cut which is three hours long. Even the shorter version is two and a half hours. It's rather long for a modern theatrical movie. This is really a Netflix mini-series. Otherwise, there are generally two major issues. The first is that the start stumbles a little. Wendy should be besides herself. Young Danny supposedly relieved her of her crazy anxiety due to the events and the movie needs to make a big show of it. Also the little girl needs to have the horrifying murder like Jacob Tremblay. A movie needs to jump off with both feet. A good start is Pennywise in the sewer eating a child. This movie's start should punch you in the face. The second is that Abra is too powerful. The only true threat comes from Crow. The Winnebago gang is inferior and it never feels that dangerous. Also why didn't Dan bring guns to the Overlook? They are not immune to bullets. It seems like a more effective weapon than an axe. Sure the axe has meaning but it is still an axe.There are some very compelling aspects in this movie. It's interesting to have this movie's versions of the old movie. McGregor is great and the girl is great. Rebecca Ferguson is very interesting as a villain. Again, the tension would be heightened if she's more powerful than the girl. Overall, it's an intriguing companion piece to the classic.",positive

"Now if you were not aware of the Original (don't be condescending if possible, not everyone can know all the movies), this is a good reason to (re)visit it - no pun intended! It will stay with you once seen and it will set the field for this sequel, which some might feel comes way too late, but than again, when should it have come out? The timing is quite good I'd say.I'd also say that the movie is quite good. I know some will disagree and will not like this at all for various reasons. Try not to expect a copy of the Shining. This is paying tribute, by also being differently when it comes to certain scares, to the story and more.I have not read the source material this is based on, but it does a good job for those who've seen the Shining and treads the story with enough respect. There are holes in the story and flaws in the telling - but overall this is entertaining and scary enough to be more than just a decent viewing",positive
"Great job Mike Flanagan.I don't know what's going on with movies lately, I have high expectations and films suck, or in this case, my expectations were fairly low, and I was blown away.What a truly worthy follow up to The Shining this was. Almost forty years on, it captures the tone, spirit and vibe of that great film.You'd think at over two and a half hours it would be overlong, it isn't,that running time allows the complex story to be told, and for the characters to be fully developed.Young Kyleigh Curran is remarkably good, and in great company with Ewan McGregor and Rebecca Ferguson, very well acted.A great start, with that amazing music, and those glorious panoramic shots. It takes time before you arrive at that destination, the one we all waited for. The recreation is remarkable.All those involved, take a bow, this was outstanding, 9/10.",positive
"With frequent flashbacks and timely references, ""Doctor Sleep"" tells the story of the adult Dan Torrance (Ewan McGregor), who survived the horrific events of 1980's ""The Shining"". This film stands alone well enough, but having seen the original movie or read the book would probably add to a richer experience for the viewer. What's a little distracting is the replacement of characters from the older movie, as the stand-ins for Jack Nicholson and Scatman Crothers for example, don't resonate as well as the more celebrated actors. The new villains from The True Knot are formidable, and characters like Rose the Hat (Rebecca Ferguson), Crow Daddy (Zahn McClarnon) and Snakebite Andi (Emily Alyn Lind) are quite charismatic, although it felt like they fell victim to the young Abra Stone (Kyliegh Curran) a bit too easily. While Colorado's Overlook Hotel took on the aspect of a character in and of itself in the original picture, here it was more of a place for Danny to return to in order to take care of unfinished business. The return of the denizens of the doomed hotel to defeat Rose was a nice touch, as well as the garden maze setting to set up the denouement. What I'd like to see now, and maybe someone could suggest it to Stephen King, is a full length novel or picture detailing the mysterious powers of Azzie the Cat. You would think the feline who played the part would have deserved a screen credit.",positive
"Without a doubt, Stanley Kubrick's adaption of ""The Shining"" was going to be a hard act to follow. It turns out that Mike Flanagan's adaptation of ""Doctor Sleep"" does a fair enough job. I read the book, and obviously the movie had to change some things to function more as a sequel to Kubrick's movie. With Danny an adult and now facing a new set of dangers, the movie has some gruesome scenes. The callbacks to the original movie were a little over-the-top, but they evoke nostalgia nonetheless. Worth seeing.",positive
"The Shining is a masterpiece from Stanley Kubrick, and one of the most renowned adaptations of a Stephen King novel (although King himself hates it), now almost forty years comes the sequel, based on the book from King, directed by Mike Flanagan (Oculus, Hush, Ouija: Origin of Evil). Basically, in 1980, sometime after escaping the Overlook Hotel, Danny Torrance (Roger Dale Floyd) and his mother Wendy (Alex Essoe) live in Florida. Danny is haunted by the ghost of the hideous old woman in the bath from the Overlook. The ghost of Dick Hallorann (Carl Lumbly) appears before him and teaches him to lock such ghosts in imaginary ""boxes"" in his mind. Meanwhile, a cult known as the True Knot, led by Rose the Hat (Rebecca Ferguson), feed on the psychic essence of young people with Shining abilities like Danny possesses to maintain their immortality. She recruits a teenage girl called Snakebite Andi (Emily Alyn Lind) into the cult after observing her ability to telepathically control people. In 2011, grown up Danny, now ""Dan"" (Ewan McGregor) is still traumatized by the events at the Overlook, he has become an alcoholic to suppress his Shining. He moves to a small town and befriends Billy Freeman (Cliff Curtis), who gets him a job and becomes his sponsor at Alcoholics Anonymous. Dan begins to improve and soon finds a job at a hospice. Three he uses his Shine abilities to comfort dying patients, who give him the nickname ""Doctor Sleep"". He begins communicating telepathically with a young girl named Abra Stone (Kyliegh Curran), whose Shining abilities are even more powerful than his. In 2018, the True Knot are starving as their supply of essence is running low. They abduct young boy Bradley Trevor (Jacob Tremblay), who has a talent playing baseball, torturing him to death to extract as much of his essence as they can. A teenage Abra senses the event, and her distress alerts both Dan and Rose. Abra is now sought by Rose who wants to extract her essence to sustain the cult. Realising that she is in danger, Abra visits Dan, he insists that she should stay away and avoid drawing attention to herself. That night, Rose projects herself into Abra's mind, but she is stunned as the girl manages to trap her, and she briefly enters Rose's mind. Wounded, Rose returns to her body and sends the True Knot to capture Abra. Dan is surprised when the ghost of Hallorann returns to visit him, he instructs him to protect Abra. Abra tells Dan what happened with Rose and says she can track the cult if she can touch the glove of the ""baseball boy"". Dan tells Billy what is going on, and they travel to the murder scene and unearth the boy's body to retrieve the glove. They go to Abra's house, Abra psychically shows her father Dave (Zackary Momoh) everything, they recruit him and devise a plan. Abra psychically projects herself as bait to lure the cult, then Dan and Billy shoot most of them dead, though Snakebite Andi telepathically manipulates Billy into killing himself before dying. Rose's lover, Crow Daddy (Zahn McClarnon), kills Dave and abducts Abra, drugging her to suppress her abilities. Dan communicates with Abra, who allows him to possess her temporarily; they make Crow Daddy crash his car, killing him and freeing Abra. While Dan and Abra reunite, Rose consumes the cult's stockpile of essence, healing her wounds and vowing revenge for their deaths. Danny decides to return to the Overlook Hotel, which has since been abandoned, he believes it will be as dangerous for Rose as it is for him and Abra. He activates all power in the boiler room, ""awakening"" it in the process. Danny revisits the rooms where his father Jack, influenced by the spirits of the hotel, attempted to murder him and Wendy. At the hotel bar, Dan is offered alcohol by a bartender (Henry Thomas) who strongly resembles Jack. Rose arrives at the hotel. Dan fails as he and Abra his attempt to lock her in a box in Dan's mind. Abra flees as Danny tries to fend off Rose with an axe, but Rose overpowers him. As she drains Dan of his essence, all the boxes in mind are opened, releasing several of the Overlook's ghosts, who quickly surround and kill Rose. Dan is possessed by the ghosts and begins to hunt for Abra. When she manages to free him momentarily, he tells her to flee the hotel. Struggling with possession, Dan returns to the boiler room, which becomes engulfed in flames. In his last moment, Dan is transported back to his childhood to experience Wendy holding him. Abra watches helplessly as the hotel burns down. Later, Abra talks to the ghost of Dan, who comforts her before disappearing. In her bathroom, Abra sees the rotting woman from the Overlook, and goes to confront her. Also starring Bruce Greenwood as Dr. John, Chelsea Talmadge as Deenie, Catherine Parker as Silent Sarey, Jocelin Donahue as Lucy Stone and The Shining's Danny Lloyd as Spectator at Baseball Game. McGregor is terrific as the grown-up Danny using his Shining for good, Ferguson is splendid as the whimsical psycho, and Curran is a wonderful new talent as the young girl with a highly powerful Shining herself. This is a completely different experience to what came before, the supernatural material is as good as before, and the immortal cult plot adds a new dimension, there are the necessary and nostalgic returns to the original movie, it has stylish visual effects and is atmospheric in its own right, and there are tense moments that work well, a worthwhile psychological horror.

"If you're a fan of Stephen King's style of writing, then there's a good chance you'll really enjoy Doctor Sleep, which is one of the most King-ian (or is that 'King-esque'?) screen adaptations of his work that I have seen in a long time, the film brimming with atmosphere and memorable characters, with all the little idiosyncrasies that make King's books so special. Hell, it's even got a weak finalé (lifted from King's original novel of The Shining, but never featured Kubrick's film).Ewan McGregor (proving to me that he CAN still act after I had almost written him off) plays Dan Torrance, all grown up, womanising, getting wasted and doing his best not to 'shine'. Travelling to a small New Hampshire town, Dan meets Billy Freeman (Cliff Curtis), who gives the 'lost soul' a chance to turn his life around, securing him a job at a local hospice. It is there that Dan earns the nickname Doctor Sleep because of his uncanny ability to comfort the patients at their moment of death. He must use the full range of his powers, however, after teenager Abra Stone (Kyliegh Curran) contacts him telepathically, warning him of a ancient tribe of people called The True Knot, who feed on those who shine, sucking up the 'steam' produced when their victims experience pain and suffering. Combining his abilities with those of Abra, Dan eventually confronts Rose The Hat (Rebecca Ferguson), leader of The True Knot, at his old 'haunt', The Overlook Hotel, where he introduces her to some familiar faces.Director Mike Flanagan (Gerald's Game) provides plenty of nods to the original Shining movie plus lots of impressively mounted scenes of his own devising (the murder of a little leaguer is genuinely disturbing and Rose's astral projection scene is stunningly executed), and he manages to hold the viewer's interest throughout despite a whopping three hour run-time and a measured pace. The build-up is so well-crafted that, when the final show-down arrives, it cannot help but feel a little anti-climactic (with the destruction of The Overlook being rather contrived). That said, as a whole this is a very admirable sequel to a much-loved horror classic and well worth checking out.",positive
"I watched this twice, 3 weeks apart, at home on DVD from my public library. Unfortunately there are no ""extras"" regarding making of the movie.Ewan McGregor is the grown up little Dan Torrance from ""The Shining."" He has had a difficult life including turning to alcohol in struggling with his innate ability to ""shine."" Unlike the first movie, which was almost entirely in the lodge in the winter, this one is set at various locations across the USA, but getting back to the lodge near the end is necessary to wrap up the story.Although this is not my favorite genre, and I'm not a big fan of ""The Shining"", I really like this movie. It has lots of complexity and interesting characters. Even though it runs a bit over 2 hours it never seemed long.Good movie and Rebecca Ferguson is also very good as Rose The Hat who with her band of shiners capture children who shine and absorb their steam so that they may live almost forever. But Dan and Abra have something to say about that.",positive
"Well, I was somewhat thrilled about sitting down to watch the 2019 movie ""Doctor Sleep"" from director Mike Flanagan, especially because this movie had a lot riding on it. How so? Well, I mean ""The Shining"" is such an iconic and mammoth of a horror movie that it left some massive footsteps for ""Doctor Sleep"" to fill out.And now that I've watched ""Doctor Sleep"", I must admit that I am left with an overwhelming sense of 'was that really it?' This movie was just a swing and a miss, especially in comparison to the legacy left by ""The Shining"", and the storyline told in ""Doctor Sleep"" was sort of pointless and essentially just felt like something left over on the cutting room table from the first movie.It should be said that they definitely had a great cast ensemble for the movie, with some interesting choices and good acting performances, Ewan McGregor and Rebecca Ferguson definitely carried the movie quite well. However, it just felt like the characters were sort of bland and rather mundane. Especially Rose the Hat, as this character was never really given the full chance to be all it could, so much wasted potential there.Visually ""Doctor Sleep"" is a good treat, lots of nice effects. I was especially impressed with the make-up and effects on the members of the True Knot group. That was just amazing.However, the movie left way too many doors opened and questions unanswered, and it felt like an incomplete movie and a half-hearted attempt to make a proper sequel to a great predecessor. I have to say that I was disappointed with this outcome of this movie. Sure, it was watchable and entertaining enough if you aren't familiar with ""The Shining"", but if you are, then this was a shallow foray into the characters, events and locations.I will say that the last part of the movie at the Overlook hotel was the best part of the movie, surprise surprise! It was such a glorious visit to that familiar and dreaded place. That was actually the best part of the movie, but it was not enough to make up for an otherwise less than mediocre storyline.My rating of ""Doctor Sleep"" is a four out of ten stars. The movie just failed to deliver where it counted, and it wasn't able to step up to filling out the shoes of ""The Shining"".",negative
"This film tells the story of a man who has to face his past, while helping a young girl.The story doesn't really connect with me. As a result, the film is not as engaging as I thought it would be. It is still suspenseful, but it doesn't send chills down my spine.",negative
"This Stephen King film adaptation will please as many fans as it confuses. No it is not another trip to the Overlook to revisit events of years ago; But Dan Torrance (Ewan McGregor) is now an adult still scarred by the trauma he endured from watching his father lose his mind at that closed winter resort. His own peace of mind is re-shattered when he meets a teenage girl, Abra (Kyliegh Curran). who has he own extrasensory gift, that is known as the 'shine"". She has sought out Dan for protection from a cult called The True Knot that seeks her out to 'feed' off of her 'shine'. Good versus evil and a quest for immortality.Violent, graphic and disturbing visions of death.

"Nearly 40 years after the events depicted in The Shining, Danny Torrance, the boy with the magical powers ('Shining'), is now a man. He has spent his whole life trying to ignore his powers and forget about those events. He has ended up in a small town in New Hampshire and is a recovering alcoholic turning his life around. Meanwhile a band of shining-endowed people are seeking out children with the gift, in order to feed off their shining. They meet their match in Abra, a teenage girl whose powers far exceed anyone else's. Danny and Abra team up to stop their murderous rampage.Great sequel to The Shining. I had low expectations for the film, figuring The Shining didn't need a sequel and this would not do it any justice. I needn't have worried.Writer-director Mike Flanagan does a good job at adapting Stephen King's novel to the silver screen. Stanley Kubrick he is not but Doctor Sleep does manage to stand on its own. Towards the end the film does rely on many scenes and settings from The Shining but for the most part it is good enough to exist on its own.Flanagan builds the intensity and intrigue well, making for riveting viewing. Despite its 2.5-hour length the film is never dull and the time seems to fly by.On the negative side, there are some aspects of the plot which seem thrown in just for complexity or twist's sake. The final few scenes feel a bit random at times due to the twists thrown in. These twists also make the plot less watertight.Overall, a great film.",positive
". . . the always eponymous Warner Bros. warn America with DOCTOR SLEEP. It turns out that one side of our current political divide are outright demons, DOCTOR SLEEP reveals. This film's characters such as ""Rose the Hat,"" ""Crow Daddy,"" ""Grandpa Flick,"" ""Snakebite Andy,"" ""Short Eddie,"" ""Diesel Doug,"" ""Silent Savoy,"" ""Apron Annie,"" and ""Barry the Chunk"" all correspond to their easily identifiable, prominent Real Life Pachyderm Party counterparts, as far as anyone with a passing familiarity for Current Events will attest. Obviously, Warner Bros. doesn't dare to make DOCTOR SLEEP's tots-under-the-scalpel tortures as horrible as the pernicious Pachyderms' ACTUAL atrocities against Immigrant Children of Color, Ukrainian civilians, our Kurdish hero\protectors, and poor working class Americans in general. However, the prophetic prognosticators working for Warner are spot-on with their depiction of baseball player ""Bradley Trevor's"" doom, foretelling the disaster awaiting the 21 Nationals sell-outs (along with their manager and coaches). It's not a pretty sight.. Perhaps the main takeaway of DOCTOR SLEEP is that we must destroy the demons walking among us with Extreme Prejudice.",positive
"When Dan Torrance was a boy, his psychic gift - his Shining - was so powerful that he became the target for evil forces which wished to consume it. Even after the family tragedy which should have ended things he had to develop defences to protect himself. As an adult he took refuge in alcohol, but something draws him to a small town in Maine where he joins Alcoholics Anonymous and gets a job in a hospice where he is able to use his gift to ease the suffering and fears of those on the point of death.Meanwhile a group of what one might call psychic vampires, headed by Rose the Hat, extend their lifespans by consuming the psychic lifeforces - which they call ""steam"" of psychically gifted individuals, particularly children. They encounter the prodigiously gifted 12-year old Abra who has already met Dan (albeit without them actually meeting each other). Can Dan protect Abra against a group of predators who have been successful for hundreds of years?Stephen King's book continues Danny Torrance's story, but is a sequel to The Shining only in the loosest sense. This film, however, is a direct sequel: the final third abandons the events of the book and takes up from the ending of Kubrick's film. I am one of those who loved King's book and therefore liked and loathed, in equal measure, Kubrick's film as it casually discarded the loving heart of the book and marched uncaringly into overstatement and overacting.This adaptation does a fine job of picking up Kubrick's hatchet job and restoring the heart which was missing from his film. I left the cinema very happy indeed.Ewan McGregor is a good Dan, Rebecca Ferguson is a better Rose the Hat, and Kyliegh Curran is stunningly good as Abra Stone.I loved this.",positive
"I read that Doctor Sleep was a bomb in the box office. Good thing I don't listen to critics and box office figures. I thoroughly enjoyed Doctor Sleep and I'm not ashamed to admit it.Doctor Sleep is essentially a sequel to The Shining. I haven't looked this up at all but I would venture a guess that after Mary Poppins Returns, Doctor Sleep is the longest gap for a sequel in cinematic history.The main character is Danny Torrance (Ewan McGregor), who was the little boy in The Shining. We're treated to some early footage, some a remake and some original, which establishes just who Danny is. This movie sheds some light on the occurrences in The Shining, and furthermore we learn that this ""shining"" is a gift, almost like a superpower. There are people/creatures that feed on this gift-- that manifests itself in the form of steam-- by inhaling it; so there is a little bit of Sleepwalkers in Doctor Sleep (gotta love how the Steven King stuff ties together).The plot is cohesive and compelling. Plus, I was a fan of the little girl that starred opposite Ewan McGregor. Abra (Kyliegh Curran) was smart, bold, adorable, and powerful. You couldn't ask for better qualities. She was essentially a tiny superhero. The ""Overlookers"" or whatever they were called, desperately wanted Abra for her steam. They were led by a powerful woman named Rose (Rebecca Ferguson) and it was going to take a lot to fight her off.The movie was intense with some good imagery and graphic effects. And, for us older folks, a few nostalgic throwbacks in there for old time's sake.",positive
"I waited almost 2 years to watch this because the trailer never was my thing and why should we go back to The Shining.The Shining was for me a great flick. So I didn't know what this one could do to this flick. This is more fantasy then horror but still, on his own it was a rather good flick. Towards the end you will get the connections to The Shining. You even get to see some scene's from the old flick.The acting on the other hand was really well done and the atmosphere of this flick does deliver but still I'm asking myself, why this flick?

"Doctor Sleep is in the true spirit of Steve King stories. P C culture kills King movies with over baring social messages. Characters of certain backgrounds are bound by thin character development. Cut out characters where this character has to be weak and stupid, a women has to be this way, the guy has to be this way etc. P C story has everyone coming together (B B F) the audience gets a new hash tag s moment ending which destroys a good King film. When all the Hollywood social posturing is removed from a King story we get a great bare boned flawed character development story with character development that has continuity with older stories. What works for the horror is the reality and complications of character which reflects real life people. The character's mistakes flaws etc make the character believable. The audience relates better to a real life character. Well the Danny character has P T S D from the incidents with his father in the previous Shinning movie which leads the viewer into the previous movie. Doctor Sleep follow's Father Jack's fault of alcoholism are passed onto his son Dan, and the viewer is given a hint that Danny drinks to shut out this Shinning ability. We see faults, but a good side where the flawed character can redeem himself. There is the old cook (Hallorann) from the last film which needs a favor (who only Danny's see.) pushes the story along. Cut to a different town and their is this little black girl with the this huge Shinning ability. There is no empowerment, or any other hash tag moment with the little girl character, but good character continuity story development of her character. As director/actor Eastwood once says never insult the audience intelligence but hint the sub stories and let the audience decide. I was wondering, while watching, why does this teenage girl have so much power? Then I see Abra is black and the dead cook (Hallorann) is black and asked Danny for this favor and then oooo the girl is a family member of the dead cook, because the cook said the Shinning is passed onto family members in the last movie. Just brilliant! Cut to another area of the U S A, their is a evil tribe which feeds on the Shinning good Spirits and Danny and Abra Stone now teenager must face off against this evil. Woven into DR Sleeps' main story is a P T S D sub story about facing one past, and a visit to the infamous hotel. A re-creation of a meeting with the famous Bartender scene as the story repletes itself is movie genius. A classic scene. Many parts of Doctor Sleep has historical repetition in the true spirit of The Shinning theme recurrence. Dr Sleep brilliantly creates the recurrence theme melding Shinning and Doctor Sleep into a great film with flaws, twists and sub stories. I will not give away anymore of a great film 9 stars.",positive
"First off, who in their right mind would ever believe that a sequel to THE SHINING would be a good idea, let alone a great one?DOCTOR SLEEP is that rare follow-up that has intrinsic merit of its own, and is not just a shallow, money-making venture. A unique story takes us on a truly epic adventure into the supernatural. A world where a band of gypsy-like, spiritual vampires roam the land in search of those who ""shine"". Leading them is the extremely powerful Rose The Hat (Rebecca Ferguson). She and her group are on a quest to find a young girl named Abra Stone (Kyliegh Curran), who could possibly hold the secret they've been looking for.This is also our chance to see Danny Torrance all grown up. He's Dan (Ewan McGregor) now, and his adult life has been a hellish ride full of drunken escapades. Dan just wants a quiet life in a small town, where he can dry out and forget his past. Unfortunately for him, Abra's situation comes to his attention, taking him in an unexpected direction.Writer / Director Mike Flanagan does a tremendous job of tying this movie in with Kubrick's film. There are direct references to that movie, and some very familiar characters. Having not read the Stephen King novel upon which this movie is based, I don't know how this squares with it, but it's certainly a satisfying horror film...",positive
"I'm always amazed by the weak arguments of some negative reviewers. How you can rate this movie with a low score is just a thing I can't understand. The Shining (1980) from Stanley Kubrick was/is a masterpiece, there is no doubt about that, so I get it that it is very difficult to have a sequel of the same quality but I think Mike Flanagan did a pretty good job with Doctor Sleep. We had to wait almost forty years to get this movie (I feel suddenly so old) but it was worth the wait. Doctor Sleep is a long movie but not once did I get bored as the story is just captivating from start till end. The cast was very good if not excellent. Ewan McGregor did a great job playing the now adult Danny Torrance. Rebecca Ferguson couldn't do a better job with her character. In fact nobody from the whole cast failed to deliver. I thought it was a great adaptation of Stephen Kings' novel, a worthy follow-up of The Shining, I will certainly watch this movie again. Like I watched The Shining at least five times I will now have the occasion to watch those two movies in a row in the future, that will be a great movie day.",positive
"I read through many of the reviews for this 2019 version of ""Little Women"" and noticed that most reviewers adored the film. Because of this, I assumed I also would love the movie. Sadly, however, I was left feeling ambivalent about it...and I noticed that my wife and oldest daughter felt pretty much the same way.I won't talk about the plot...after all, there's a summary on IMDB and lots of reviews talk about this. What I should mention is that the film is much more like the book than previous versions....a plus. But the reasons I still did not love this film are what stop me from recommending the film. First, there simply is too much story to cram into a little over two hours. If you are going to try to stick closer to the book, then perhaps consider making it a mini-series. This is because although the film is more like the book, to do this they also omit a lot of things....making the story seem a bit disjoint and confusing. Second, I really didn't think they did a good job of helping the viewers to actually care about the characters. Some of this was because the little women in the story were poorly chosen--much too old in some cases (the 12 year-old early in the story looked to be about 20). Some was because the choppiness of the story really harmed the film because the characters just seemed one-dimensional. Overall, a decent story but even with its sticking closer to the book, I much preferred the 1990s version...which was much more charming, fun and likable.",positive
"Louisa May Alcott's 'Little Women' has long been one of my all-time favourite books and love 'Good Wives' just as much. The story is just so charming and fills me with joy and emotion every time, all the major events are memorable, the major relationships beautifully fleshed out and all the characters are interesting and well defined, as well as worth relating to. There is no wonder as to why it is so oft-adapted (and generally very well).It is such a good story and the characters are so good that it remains timeless regardless of how many it is read and how often it's adapted. The latest adaptation, written and directed by Greta Gerwig, responsible for 'Lady Bird' (one of my favourites from its year), and starring Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Meryl Streep and Laura Dern (the four biggest names), is the eighth adaptation. And along with the 1994 film with Winona Ryder and Susan Sarandon and the 1933 film starring Katharine Hepburn it is one of the best. Some may not be totally enamoured with it as an adaptation, as the chronology is different and there is a lot of back and forth, but on its own terms it left me and my sisters totally satisfied.Will admit to not being completely grabbed at the start, with it being the worst case of the backing and forthing from Jo's point of view not always working. On the most part this aspect does work surprisingly well, but there were times where it was confusing and not always easy to tell straight away what was the past and what was the present and that was the case with this 'Little Women'.Although the acting is outstanding nearly all-round, for me Louis Garrel was somewhat bland as Professor Bhaer. The character is not the most interesting character in 'Good Wives' in the first place, but with his role being so small here the character felt very underwritten and Garrel doesn't bring an awful lot to it.These two problems are vastly outweighed by everything else and the best of everything else is fantastic. Three things are especially good. The production values are exquisite throughout, the costumes are evocative and the settings have a cosiness and charm that reminds me fondly of the period films of films from MGM in the 40s and 50s. The darker look of the present scenes contrast beautifully with the warm looking past ones. Just in case one is wondering, that is a compliment or at least to me it is. Alexandre Desplat is one of the best film composers working today and his score fits the film and the spirit of the story perfectly, the triumphant moments exploding with sumptuous joy and the emotional ones enhanced by the sorrowful-sounding orchestration. Ronan is quite sensational as Jo, one of her best performances to date in a performance that is sensitive and spirited.Everybody else, Garrel excepted and that was to do with the limitations of the role, also excels. Have not seen Watson better than here, epitomising sympathetic charm even in her desiring of better. Florence Pugh is truly excellent as and the embodiment of older Amy which suited her more than when playing her when younger. While criticisms of her being less convincing as younger Amy where the character is more petulant and spoilt it is not easy not making younger Amy too bratty (especially in the burning of the book incident), it is not hard to see as to why this has been a breakthrough year for Pugh. Eliza Scanlan is a very moving Beth, especially later on, while Laura Dern is a sincere and loving Marmee, Timothee Chamalet is a charming Laurie and has great chemistry with all four leads (especially Ronan) and no other actor for Mr Laurence has made my heart melt more than Chris Cooper. Streep is a very amusing Aunt March.Regarding the storytelling and character writing, 'Little Women' is a near triumph. The story is heart-warming and moving, although the chronology is different and sometimes coherence is affected the spirit and a lot of the major events of 'Little Women' and 'Good Wives' are intact and with full impact. The transitions from past to present and vice versa are mostly quite seamless. Loved the interaction between the four sisters, which charmed, amused and moved in equal measure throughout, while this adaptation is the best at including and fleshing out the triangle between Jo, Laurie and Amy. Jo and Beth's chemistry was incredibly heartfelt and for me the film's big tragedy was heart-wrenching (same with my sisters and everybody in the cinema in a packed auditorium male and female and of all ages), and having Jo's strength and struggles as a writer mirroring Alcott herself was a clever move and a valid one considering Jo was a personal character for Alcott. Almost all the characters are well defined, with strengths and flaws and how they dealt with their triumphs and struggles. Gerwig directs with great confidence and the script sparkles, the charm and poignancy of the story and Alcott's text never lost or jarring.Summing up, a great film and what a way to spend New Year's Day. 9/10",positive
"It's the classic American story by Louisa May Alcott about the March sisters; Jo (Saoirse Ronan), Meg (Emma Watson), Amy (Florence Pugh), and Beth (Eliza Scanlen). During the Civil War, their father is away helping the Union troops. Their mother Marmee (Laura Dern) leads the girls in doing good deeds for the community. Theodore 'Laurie' Laurence (Timothée Chalamet) is the new boy moving in with his rich grandfather. The movie opens with young adult Jo trying to sell a story in New York City. It would alternate between the adult sisters and their younger teenage selves.I have never read the book although this is the fourth adaptation, among the countless versions, that I have seen. Greta Gerwig has changed it up and in the process, has given even more depth and more life to the characters. She has added to the theme of the story. She divides the movie into about half teenage years and half young adult years. In many ways, the romance between Amy and Laurie is given more space to grow. Saoirse, Florence, and Timothée gave the movie three great performances. They are backed by solid work from the likes of Laura Dern and Emma Watson. My only problem is the furnishings in this house. It's a little too nice considering that they give away so much to the needy. Overall, this is the best adaptation of the four that I've seen.",positive
"After brilliant versions, what to expect ? Beautiful costumes, fair atmosphere, nuanced performances. And wise, in final, ignore of chronology. And all is good first for lead actors and for the gifts to young Saoirse Ronan and Timotee Chalamet and Emma Watson and Louis Garrel to give their Little Women.For us, the brilliant columns - Chris Cooper and Meryl Streep, not ignoring Laura Dern or Jayne Houdishell . So, a nice adaptation. Not great, not memorable , not the best. Only beautiful. And polite.",positive
"It's beautifully shot, beautifully acted, and I understand that in order to appeal to succeeding generations, any classic must have some point that the latest kids will find telling. Nonetheless, Greta Gerwig's efforts to make this appealing to modern, Fourth Wave Feminists by having everyone from Meryl Streep as Aunt March on down go on about the subservient position of women in this era, by having Saoirse Ronan as Jo March write Little Woman, and then get into an argument with the publisher, insisting that the character remain unmarried. This destroys the ending, but of course there are more important things,The actors are excellent, particularly Laura Dern as Marmee. Chris Cooper as Mr. Lawrence does not, alas, get his fake-ogre introduction. Despite the beautiful camerawork and acting, the flash-forward-flashback structure imposed on the movie and the modernist interpretation destroys the film for me. I'll stick to the 1933 version, and perhaps revisit the book.",negative
"Little Women is a new 2019 film that runs for over 2 hours and, fittingly with the title, this is the most recent filmmaking effort by successful actress, but now even more successful writer and director, Greta Gerwig. Still considerably younger than 40, she is slowly but steadily turning into the most lauded female filmmaker from her generation, especially if we restrict this description to Americans. She may not have succeeded a second time with gettting in for Best Director at the Oscars, bit looking at the huge success with awards bodies for ""Little Women"", I am sure she isn't too sad about that. The latter also includes a screenplay nomination for Gerwig herself and from what I have read, the film definitely has a chance to triumph and get her her first Academy Award. It's maybe between this one and ""Jojo Rabbit"" with ""Joker"" being a potential dark horse. My money would be on ""Jojo Rabbit"", but we will see what happens next weekend. As for the other nominations, this film has no chance to win Best Picture, Best Actress or Best Supporting Actress. Pugh's inclusion for the latter was a bit of a surprise already, but having watched the film now, I believe it is not undeserving at all as her turn was among the best aspects this film had to offer. I am personally happy for her too because I liked her in other projects. Desplat may be a legend by now when it comes to soundtracks, but there the chances are also fairly slim. A win for Costume Design seems more likely and again the main opposition in this category comes probably from ""Jojo Rabbit"". So much for the awards and this was really just a slight reference that does not remotely reflect all the awards this film has been nominated for (and won). So it is not a surprise by any definition that this has turned into the most known adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's novel by now. By far. There have been far more adaptations than you would think, but maybe it needed Gerwig's take on the subject because she is a female too to really make a major impact. Then again, I prefer the idea that she is just really talented and that is why it turned out such a success.For Gerwig, it is her second collaboration with lead actress Saoirse Ronan in a row and as both have resulted in Oscar Lead Actress nominations for the Irish-American actress, we can expect there will be more movies between these two in the future. And not just because of that. What is at least as important is the high quality obviously. I think they made some really wise decisions with the cast here. Ronan is among the very best actresses from her generation. Watson has been there for a while too, even if the really big awards attention is still missing for her. In any case, she is a gigantic crowd magnet. Florence Pugh has joined the elite too with her recent portrayals and finally Eliza Scanlen I must admit I have not been familiar with before this film, but she is okay, does not have too much to work with though, not the material to really stand out the way her co-actresses do. The girls' mother is played by Laura Dern. She has one or two occasions to shine, but other than that, her character is also mostly there to propel the girls. She can live with that as she is pretty safe for winning an Oscar this year for another supporting performance. Bob Odenkirk I was quite happy to see here as I am a big Breaking Bad fan and also like his spin-off show. Shame he is barely in this one here. Chris Cooper is a nice addition as always and plays a truly likable character. Meryl Streep is in the very first scene and has 2 or 3 more scenes later on and there is some great presence to her character, even if she is not featured too heavily. This description applies to others as well.The one male character who is really a lot in this film is played by Timothée Chalamet. I don't need to say much about his background, do I? He has been everywhere recently. His frequent inclusion here is no surprise because his character's lifestyle, but even more so his relationship with the girls, is a major aspect from beginning to end. This especially applies to his scenes with Pugh and Ronan. With the youngest sister, there is no connection and with Watson's, there is only one scene when he tells her he finds her beautiful (even if he does not like her dress). I kept wondering throughout the film if he will end up with one of the girls. His somewhat final words to Ronan's character when she rejects him stay in the mind that she will find somebody else and he will watch because this is excactly how it happens at the very end when Garrel's character returns. Even if it was maybe not too easy for Laurie (Chalamet) to witness, it was still somewhat funny how he kept asking who this man was because he saw her being attracted to him. So no dark bummer ending here. Besides, even if the protagonist (Jo/Ronan) reconsidered her decision and wanted to be with Chalamet's character despite not loving him, it was all good the way it turned out because he seemed happy with Amy in the end and she loved him since day. You can see romance is really the key aspect here. Still, this is a film that will make you laugh here and there too. The audience in my showing loved the maid's statement about Garrel's character being so handsome towards the end. And the 2 minutes of hair struggles (how she sold them, what Amy says, how she cries over her lost hair, not over her dad) were funnier than entire 90-minute full comedy films. I loved it.Of course, in addition to that, we also get a great deal of drama, even tragedy. The latter especially refers to the youngest sister and her fading health. When we find out she died, it's clearly the saddest moment of the film, especially because right before that, things seemed to have improved considerably and we also see Amy around again, who had to leave earlier for a while because they had to avoid her perhaps getting sick as well. Still, it was these events that made the sisters form an even stronger bond. Of course, there are conflicts, not only about men, but also the ones all sisters have with each other. One is sad because she is not allowed to join the others to the theater, so she burns the protagonist's writings. But she regrets her act immediately after and apologizes. Still, as a direct consequence, the protagonist does not warn her about the ice not being too thick at the center of the lake and the younger sister almost drowns there. Some truly shocking moments, even if we sort of knew what was about to happen. They hug it out immediately afterwards. Now I just mentioned the writing. This is just one area in which these girls are talented. Each of them has creative drive: One is an aspiring writer. One is a talented painter. One is a good musician. And the last one (played by Watson) may have aspired to become an actress as we only find out through one quote.Maybe it is this creative force that for me resulted in the impression that every time all four of them were together on screen, you could really feel their energy in the room. This was especially true during the scene when we have the four meet Chalamet's character for the first time. The moment when we find out about Meg's talent (Watson) is also one that is very telling about Ronan's character. She says that her sister should leave with her and try to become an actress instead of staying with her man because she cannot see why somebody would choose a relationship over passion/talent, especially a woman. She played a very progressive character in these really not emancipated times of the Civil War. At the end, the central character falls for somebody herself, so she is not entirely against the idea anymore of her fictitious(?) character marrying at the end of the book. So she is about to have a marriage with somebody she adores (Garrel) as well as have a career to be an independent woman. It is possible. I think the way they combined her talking with the publisher with her happy romance ending was very smartly executed and edited. In general, this film shows amazing attention to detail at times.Still, I cannot say this was a perfect watch. Here and there I struggled a bit with it, but then again period pieces are not exactly my number one preferred genre. There is of course no hesitation for me in giving this film a thumbs-up, but nonetheless I shall elaborate a bit on what I did not like that much. It was mostly just minor moments. For example, I wondered why Streep's character was so worried about financial aspects as she was really rich herself and probably could have provided for every family member easily if it was necessary. What I struggled a bit more with were the jumps in time. I would have preferred chronological narration altogether. When Jo was sporting her new haircut, it certainly helped a bit with seeing at what point in time we are right now, but before that it was difficult, especially because there was an unusual jump back in time (7 years) really quickly after the introduction that is really not seen too often when a film just started 20 minutes ago or so. The make-up helped a bit too in understanding which year it was at that point. Oh well, maybe it was just me who struggled to understand and it will get easier on rewatch. Nonetheless, there is no doubt for me that the good moments this film has are far more frequent than the weaker ones. So it gets a positive recommendation from me for sure. I generally do not like saying a film is more suitable for a female audience, but looking at the gender proportion in my showing and how much (judging from screams and noises) women in the crowd seemed more involved with the story (let alone, this being at its core a story about 4 girls), I think it may be somewhat true for this one here. So go watch it with your girlfriend for her birthday perhaps. She will love you even more afterward. By the way, I was really surprised how full the theater was. It deserves to be seen. Go for it.",positive
"The original novel by Louisa May Alcott, released as two volumes in 1868 and 1869, is an enduring classic, and has produced a good number of film adaptations. There were two silent films in 1917 and 1918, was the 1933 Katharine Hepburn (first sound) version, there was the 1949 Elizabeth Taylor/Janet (first colour) version, there was the 1994 Winona Ryder/Kirsten Dunst/Claire Danes version, and there was the 2018 modern day take to celebrate the novel's 150th anniversary. With Awards Season coming up, this seventh feature film adaptation was being tipped for a few award gongs, directed by Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird). Basically, set in the nineteenth century, it sees the struggles and adventures of the four March sisters, going backwards and forwards in time. In 1868, Josephine ""Jo"" March (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Saoirse Ronan) is a teacher in New York City. She goes to an editor, Mr. Dashwood (Tracy Letts), he confirms he will publish her work, subject to considerable editing. Her sister Amy (Oscar and BAFTA nominated Florence Pugh), in Paris with their wealthy Aunt March (Meryl Streep), sees childhood friend Theodore ""Laurie"" Laurence (Timothée Chalamet) and invites him to a party. At the party she is angry at his drunken behavior. Meanwhile, Jo meets with Friedrich Bhaer (Louis Garrel), a professor infatuated with her, and he gives her constructive criticism of her work. Afterward, Jo gets a letter saying that her younger sister Elizabeth ""Beth"" (Eliza Scanlen) has gotten sicker, so she returns home. In 1861, in Concord, Massachusetts, Jo and her older sister Margaret ""Meg"" (Emma Watson) go to a party where Jo meets Laurie, the grandson of their neighbour Mr. Laurence (Chris Cooper). On Christmas morning, their mother, affectionately called Marmee (Laura Dern) persuades the girls to give their breakfast to their poor neighbour, Mrs. Hummel (Sasha Frolova). Upon returning home, the girls are surprised to find their table full of food, provided by Mr. Laurence, and a letter from their father fighting in the Civil War. Jo visits their Aunt March, who invites Jo to Europe with her. Amy is invited in by Laurie, following a school punishment for misbehaving in class, before her family comes to take her home. When Meg, Jo, Laurie and John Brooke (James Norton), Laurie's tutor, go out one night, an angry and jealous Amy burns Jo's writings, upsetting Jo. Amy attempts to apologise but to no avail. The next morning Amy chases Jo, ice skating with Laurie. Amy breaks through the ice and almost drowns but is saved Jo and Laurie. That night, Jo expresses guilt over what happened to Amy. Mr. Laurence's grumpy nature is softened upon meeting Beth, he learns of her musical talent and offers her the use of his grand piano. In the present, Laurie visits Amy to apologise for his behaviour at the party. Later, he urges Amy not to marry Fred Vaughn (Dash Barber), but to marry him instead. She turns him down, thinking she is the second choice, after Jo, she also turns down a proposal from Fred, only to learn that Laurie has left for London. In the past, Marmee is informed that their father is ill from the war in Washington, D. C. Jo sells her hair in order to help their mother travel to care for him. Beth is given the piano from Mr. Laurence, but contracts scarlet fever from an infant, part of a family of poor people she was helping. Amy, who has not had the disease before, is sent to Aunt March. Marmee comes home early when Beth gets worse, but she recovers in time for Christmas, with their father surprising the girls returning home. On Meg's wedding day Jo tries to convince her to run away, but Meg tells her she is happy getting married. Aunt March announces her trip to Europe but decides to take Amy instead of Jo. After the wedding, Laurie admits his feelings for Jo, but she insists she does not feel the same way. In the present, Beth's condition worsens, and she eventually dies. Later, Marmee reveals a devastated Amy was returning home with a sick Aunt March. Jo wonders whether she was too quick in turning Laurie down and writes him a letter. On their way back, Amy tells Laurie she turned down Fred's proposal. The two kiss and later marry on the journey home. Returning home, Laurie catches up with Jo and they agree to just be friends. Outside, Jo throws away the letter she wrote for Laurie. The next day, Jo begins writing a novel based on the lives of her and her sisters. She sends the first chapters to Mr. Dashwood, and Bhaer turns up at the March house on his way to California to teach. In New York, Mr. Dashwood was unimpressed, but his daughters found the chapters of Jo's book and ask how it ends. He agrees to publish the book, as long as Jo amends her ending so that the main character will marry. Jo then chases after Bhaer and stops him from going to California. She negotiates copyright and royalties with Mr. Dashwood. Later, Jo has opened a school in Aunt March's house, who gave it to her after she died. Her book has been printed, titled Little Women. Also starring Jayne Houdyshell as Hannah. Ronan gives a trailblazing performance as the tomboyish sister, Pugh is splendid as the aspiring artist sister, Watson and Scanlen are fine, and there is good support from Chalamet, Streep, Dern, Cooper and others. The past versions did the story in linear order, this version going backwards and forwards in time does put a new spin on things, the script is fresh and does embrace the source material well, it is charming and has a splendid use of colour and costumes, a memorable and worthwhile coming-of-age period drama. It won the Oscar for Best Costume Design, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Adapted Screenplay for Greta Gerwig, and Best Original Score for Alexandre Desplat, it won the BAFTA for Best Costume Design, and it was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Original Music, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score. Good!",positive
"My wife and I watched this at home on BluRay from our public library. There are several interesting ""extras"" on the disc.This is writer/director Greta Gerwig's movie. Most of her life she has admired the literary work, and has admired Alcott. She jumped at the chance to write the script and direct the movie. The result is a movie a bit different from prior versions and with Gerwig's own spin of what she thinks Alcott would have preferred.We enjoyed the movie but frankly some of the editing choices made it difficult to follow the story and to differentiate between the times when the girls were younger teenagers and when they were young adults. It added a bit of confusion which took away from the viewing pleasure.In this version Jo is played by Saoirse Ronan. I am a big fan of hers and to me her two best roles are in ""Hanna"" in 2011 and ""Brooklyn"" in 2015. But the role of Jo was not the best for her, I think Maya Hawke did it much better, was more authentic as Jo in the 1997 3-hour miniseries.But those are not major points, we enjoyed this movie even though we both think the editing was more confusing than helpful to tell the stories here.",positive
"I didn't know the story beforehand, so I was rather confused by the non linear story line. I do one the costumes and the acting in the film.",negative
"The Louisa May Alcott novel has been oft filmed, so I wondered what new take could be given on it.Thankfully this turns out to be a joy, with a wonderful central performance from Saoise Ronan.Certainly a film worth watching.",positive
"This is a super (if rather freely) adapted version of the Alcott story about a family of sisters as they come of age towards the end of the American Civil War. I suppose that I do, personally, prefer the 1949 version - it has a little more feistiness. In this iteration though, Saoirse Ronan is great as the independently minded author determined to go through life on her own terms; no mean feat at the time. Emma Watson, Florence Pugh and Laura Dern are good too as her sisters/mother respectively (though the accents are a wee bit dodgy on occasion). Meryl Streep has some cracking one-liners and has her facial expressions perfected. The star for me, however, is Timothée Chalamet - he plays the charming but emotionally fickle ""Laurie"" in a thoroughly captivating, engaging manner. The attention to detail is impressive and Alexandre Desplat's score helps the whole thing to come alive. It does sag in the middle; could perhaps do with shaving 15-20 minutes to tighten it up a little, but otherwise a thoroughly entertaining watch.",positive
"I approached this movie and the subsequent report on it with two strikes on me; 1) I am male, and 2) I haven't read the novel. If it comes to that I haven't read any of what we might call 'girl' novels, Anne of Green Gables, Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, What Katy Did, and if any were filmed I didn't see them but I do know they EXIST, just as I knew Little Women existed before checking it out. If gorgeous beautifully shot rural settings make for good movies then this is a good movie. In a way it is reminiscent of the nod to Currier & Ives in Meet Me In St Louis except here the accent is rural rather than urban. I have to guess that someone on the 'creative' team has seen fit to make the action move back and forth in no apparent pattern which may well make sense if one knew the book. For instance it wasn't immediately apparent to me that Jo actually lived in New York for blocks of time rather than just travelling to see a publisher - it might also have helped to know the distances involved i.e. was it feasible to make a day trip to Ne York from the area of New England where the Marches make their home. I've already praised the camerawork and the acting is equally good with Laura Dern scoring heavily as the mother whilst Meryl Streep appears to have phoned it in for once.",negative
"Set during the American Civil War and after, the story of four young sisters - Jo, Meg, Amy and Beth - their lives and loves, triumphs and heartbreaks and growing up.There have been several adaptations of Louisa May Alcott's classic novel with the 1949 (directed by Mervyn Leroy and starring June Allyson, Elizabeth Taylor, Janet Leigh, Mary Astor and Peter Lawford) and 1994 (starring Winona Ryder, Claire Danes, Kirsten Dunst, Christian Bale, Susan Sarandon, Gabriel Byrne and Eric Stoltz) versions being the best among them. Both were excellent, with the 1949 version to the fore (a 9/10 for me, vs 8/10 for the 1994 version).With this adaptation, writer-director Greta Gerwig (whose previous film was the wonderful 'Lady Bird') does her best to create something new, using a non-linear storyline and some departures from the novel. Ultimately, however, while still quite enjoyable it is not in the same league as the 1949 and 1994 versions.The non-linearity - jumping back and forth between the women in the adult years to their younger years - while novel, detracts from the plot. It is difficult to build any momentum or engagement due to the back-and-forthness. In addition, it wrecks any intrigue regarding relationships and other developments in the sisters' younger lives, as you can see how it pans out.The film also doesn't have the warmth that the other two films had. While the bond and camaraderie between the sisters is reasonably well demonstrated, it just feels a bit hollow.This said, it's a decent telling of the story with some solid performances, especially from Saoirse Ronan as Jo and Florence Pugh as Amy. However, I found Timothee Chalamet, as Laurie, a tad irritating and Laura Dern seemed miscast as Marmee.Very uplifting, emotional ending which ties everything together quite nicely.",positive
"Greetings again from the darkness. More than 150 years have passed since Louisa May Alcott's novel was published (volume 1 was published in 1868, volume 2 in 1869). By my count, there have been seven previous movie adaptations, dating back to the silent film era and through the more familiar George Cukor-Katharine Hepburn (1933), Mervyn Leroy-June Allyson (1949), and Gillian Armstrong-Wynona Ryder (1994) versions. One might think that sufficient, yet, after viewing this latest, you'll likely join me in believing that director Greta Gerwig and Louisa May Alcott (and by natural extension Jo March) are kindred spirits ... timeless storytellers of the moment.Oscar nominated (writing and directing) for her standout LADY BIRD (2017), Ms. Gerwig remains true to the beloved source material while adding her own contemporary touch. She begins with the adult March sisters and then flashing back 7 years to the stage of living together and battling through the difficult and awkward transitional phase. The four sisters Jo (Saoirse Ronan), Meg (Emma Watson), Amy (Florence Pugh), and Beth (Eliza Scanlen) are exceptionally well cast, and we immediately recognize the familiar personality traits of each. Jo is the serious, determined writer who has an understanding of financial necessities. Meg is the warm facilitator beloved by all. Amy has ambitions (or is it dreams?) of being a great artist and living an exceptional life. Beth, the youngest, radiates a sweet nature and love for the piano.Much of the story is told through the eyes of Jo. Her independent spirit and frustration with how the world is, boils over at times. She states her disappointment at being born a girl, and is described as having ""a nature too noble to curb."" While viewing, one must keep in mind that this was the Civil War era (the girls' father is a military Chaplain), and women had achieved very few rights in society. The contrast is never more evident than when comparing Marmee (Laura Dern), presented here as a near flesh-and-blood saint, with Aunt March (Meryl Streep), one quite at ease in thumbing her nose at societal norms for one reason ... she is rich.Fans of the novel will be pleased that Timothee Chalamet plays ""Laurie Laurence"", who struggles every bit as much as the sisters in finding his way towards adulthood. His scenes with Jo are exceptional. Chris Cooper, not seen nearly enough in movies these days, perfectly captures the broken spirit of Mr. Laurence, a man never quite able to escape his own personal loss. Other key cast members include James Norton as tutor/teacher John Brooke, Louis Garrel as Friedrich (here a Frenchman), and Tracy Letts dropping some deadpan comedy as Jo's publisher Mr Dashwood.Ms. Gerwig (perhaps with a future as one of the greatest filmmakers) displays storytelling and cinematic craftsmanship at the highest level. She bounces between timelines (over at least 7 years) and different sisters' stories, showing how each is so different ... yet all interconnected. These spirited sisters, raised in the same modest home, have their own independent thoughts and ideas of how they want to live their lives. This delivers multiple comings-of-age and examines 'a woman's place', whatever that means. In fact, the message is that a woman's place is whatever she decides, and while her options are many (despite obstacles), her decisions are personal. None of the four sisters are played by American actors, and all four perform admirably. Pay particular attention to Florence Pugh (MIDSOMMAR) and her work as Amy. Also impressive is the Production Design by Jess Gonchor and the score by 2-time Oscar winner Alexandre Desplat. This one is all about the storytelling and characters, so take in the bunch known as the March sisters. As a side note, Greta Gerwig's next movie is a live-action BARBIE movie, with Margot Robbie in the lead.",positive
Saoirse Ronan is such an enchanting actress she brings life to the character. She is the best actress to play Jo March. in the 94 movie Winona was lovely but not as fine. In the 49 movie June Allyson wasn't appealing enough.The story was told in a flashback manner with lots of jumping around in time. If you don't already know the story well it can be confusing and loses impact especially when showing the death of Beth.Apart from Saoirse Ronan the casting isn't great. Timothée is too teen looking and too millennial. Laura Dern isn't very motherly in demeanour. Didn't like the Professor played by Louis - he looked a bit sleazy for the role. Emma Watson looked too child like to be the eldest sister.Imperfect but worth a watch.,positive
"I won't set out the plot of this film. This is only partly because the plot of Louisa May Alcott's novel is so well known. It's also because the film is so confusing that I couldn't actually understand a lot of it. Writer/director Greta Gerwig has chosen to tell the story in a peculiarly non-linear way, with flashbacks, flash-forwards, flashbacks within a flash-forward, flash-forwards within a flashback, and...you get the general idea. The only way I could make any sense of it was from my knowledge of the novel itself and of previous film and TV adaptations. This must be the only version of ""Little Women"" in which Beth not only dies but also comes back from the dead. (At least once and possibly twice). I don't think this was intended as a Lazarus-type resurrection, merely a side-effect of non-linear narration.The film differs from earlier versions of the story in a number of ways. Jo's admirer, Professor Friedrich Bhaer, is, in the book and in most previous films, considerably older than her, but here he is a young man of around the same age, more undergrad than professor. At one time older man/younger woman romances were common currency in Hollywood, possibly because the average Hollywood producer is an elderly or middle-aged male with a much younger trophy wife, but the effects of the #Metoo movement may have made film-makers uneasy about depicting relationships of this sort. The March family are normally described as living in ""genteel poverty"", but here they seem pretty well heeled, especially when compared to a genuinely poor family like the Hummels. They are, admittedly, poor when compared to their wealthy aunt, but only in the way that a millionaire is poor when compared to a billionaire.I am, in a way, sorry to have to be so critical about the film because there are some good things about it. It is, for example, visually attractive, reminiscent of a British ""heritage cinema"" period drama, and I liked Alexandre Desplat's musical score. There are some good acting performances. Pride of place in this respect must go to Saoirse Ronan as the determined, independent-minded and feisty Jo, but I was also struck by Timothée Chalamet as Jo's other admirer Laurie and Meryl Streep in a cameo as Aunt March. Ronan and Chalamet also appeared together in Gerwig's previous film, ""Lady Bird"", like this one a coming-of-age film but with a modern setting. Ronan is the only one of the four actresses playing the March sisters to have been born in America, and even she has spent more of her life in her parents' native Ireland; Emma Watson (Meg) and Florence Pugh (Amy) are British and Eliza Scanlen (Beth) Australian.My favourite screen adaptation of ""Little Women"" probably remains the one from the early nineties, but I will not make direct comparisons as it is a long time since I last saw that film. Greta Gerwig's film is in some respects better than the 1949 version with Elizabeth Taylor; it is, for example, better acted. (That film contained some strange examples of miscasting). Gerwig's narrative style, however, meant that her take on the story never moved fluently and never really held my attention. 5/10",negative
"I've had lots of troubles, so I write jolly tales. Jo March (Saoirse Ronan)Yes, the troubles of the March girls in Greta Gerwig's adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's Little Women are not a few, including death, disease, and men. The last item is the recurring danger for 19th century women who disregard the iron clad warning, from mothers mostly, that a girl is guaranteed success and safety if she marries and marries well. Jo is not like other girls because she holds out as long as possible in her spinsterhood while she pursues her writing career.Writer/director Gerwig does the impossible: She makes the novel new by letting the girls, especially Jo, direct their lives with energy and love. No better household occupies other movies this year, or almost any year. With Jo the spirit at the center, they represent the longing of women who are on the cusp of being recognized as intelligent and creative.In the family are a writer, a painter, an actress, and a pianist, about as representative of the muses as you can get. Gerwig enthusiastically directs the actresses to run in all directions on their own. As an ensemble, the cast may be the best of 2019; as individual actresses they give the audience a full measure of strength and weakness.With soft golden interior light and bathing sunlight through the windows and in the outdoors, Gerwig gives the nostalgic and warming ambience needed for us to love and respect these romantic characters. Alexandre Desplat's music, although at times intrusive, is mostly spot on to support moment and thoughts.Greta Gerwig has a masterful film that should be nominated for an Oscar. As for those actresses, they work so well together that they may cancel each other at Oscar time. Whatever, because they embody the bright, emerging young feminists we promote today: tough, ambitious, and loving--only over a century and a half ago. Greta and Saoirse-Alcott would write about them if she were alive.",positive
"Little Women a film that has been done many times is one that entertains with drama and love as it's a sprawling journey of life, love, and choices. The film is a reflection of life thru flashbacks also as it looks at the times of the March sisters. Told mostly thru the eyes and point of view of one young up and comer Jo March(Saoirse Ronan) it shows how her and her sisters lived life with hope, energy, and love. As Jo longed for success to become a writer holding out for respect hoping that her intelligence would be known all while spinning sisterhood. The scenes are filled with many outdoor takes as it seems the characters were always on a journey. And the picture is a showcase for the talents of the March family as it features a writer, painter, actress, and musician. The chemistry of the cast is in top notch form with good work from Laura Dern and Emma Watson. May not be everyone's cup of tea still it's a masterful work of storytelling and art!",positive
"Likewise, Gerwig vibrantly carves out a pellucid orbit to point up the story's undeniable feminist slant on steroids, never preaching or showboating, through the words tailored to the quartet siblings and even the snide Aunt March (Streep, chewing the scenery a bit, but a perfect foil to balance the sisters' wholesomeness), the film lays bare the shackles thrown down on women of that time (19th century) by the patriarchal society, meanwhile respects each girl's different life choices, although it is Jo's canny smartness, savvy resilience and talent as a self-sufficient writer that is eulogized as the centerpiece in the ambiguous ending, has Jo married to the criminally handsome Professor Friedrich Bhaer (Garrel) or not? read my full review on my blog: cinema omniovre",positive
"My parents read Little Women to me when I was a child (I found it boring but have no memory beyond that), and I've seen three adaptations that I didn't care for, so I only watched this one because my girlfriend wanted to.But much to my surprise, this was much better than what I recall of the rest.In my head, Little Women is the story of one interesting character, Jo, and a set of frilly girls who left no impression. But instead of offering one tomboy and a bunch of girly-girls, director Gerwig offers a rambunctious tribe. There is a physicality to all the girls I only remember Jo having, and while this makes Jo stand out a little less, it gives the story a lot more drive.And while I've felt Little Women always pushed a ""real writers don't write pirate stories"" moral that I find objectionable, this version has a more nuanced view that is more about the reasons a writer might organically change genres.While the non-linear story sometimes had me confused, and while Soirse Ronan's Jo isn't as compelling as Katherine Hepburn's overall this is easily the best version of Little Women. Definitely worth watching (although I am torn between giving it a 7 and an 8).",positive
"This most recent take on the old Louise M Alcott classic novel (and there have been many), shakes up certain aspects of the story with its time-shifting narrative and nods to feminism and creative artists, but the end result is still recognisable despite its mild modernist makeover.The story should be familiar, concerning the four daughters of the March family, who, while father is away from home fighting for Lincoln in the American Civil War, are busy growing up in Massachussetts, one house down from the rich widower living in his grand mansion, alongside his feckless, baby-faced son and one door up for the slum-shack inhabited by a poor, sick family in need of charity and fast.I will admit to some confusion at times over the treatment of the timelines which interconnect here. Only once did I see a ""seven years earlier"" subtitle, near the start of the film, but from then, was left to ascertain where, or more to the point, when I was from the context of the scene or the appearance of the actors themselves, the latter, in particular proving little help when the physical signs of a character being younger or older were difficult to detect, certainly any changes in fashion weren't helping. I don't mind being made to work and pay attention during a movie, but some more date-subtitling would probably have helped.The story begins and ends with the erstwhile oldest sister of the March brood, Jo, the budding author amongst them. Somewhat tomboyish in her manner and appearance, the questions are immediately posed, will success and true love find her and of course the answers by the close are inevitable. From there we're gradually introduced to her family, their conscientious mother, whom they all ridiculously call """"Marmee"" and three sisters, all equally, if improbably, aspirant in the arts, one for acting, another for art and the youngest for music. Not your average family then, the only other one I can think of in life, so similarly ambitious being the one helpfully referenced at one point, the Brontes.The lives, loves and deaths of the family are then somewhat haphazardly set before the viewer but as indicated, I didn't think this modernist non-linear approach helped the story-telling. This is a family saga and better told, I think from back-to-front. I know that's the way the story has always been filmed but different doesn't always work and this reworking I think is a case in point. The sets and costumers were fine but I was doubtful of some of the casting and performances. Saoirse Ronan seems too old for her part and Timothée Chalomet way too young for his, this most apparent in their scenes together. None of the other acting I saw really reached out to me either as the phrase ""playing the clothes"" came to mind.My wife and I had reasonable hopes of this slightly seasonal family drama this Christmas Eve but were left thinking a little less family and a little more drama might have been in order.",negative
"Little Women (2019)' is the umpteenth adaptation of its source novel, yet the first which I have seen. Apparently, its time-hopping structure is entirely new, seemingly included to call attention to the story's various call-backs and contrasts, and has caused some confusion among audiences unfamiliar with the book. I can't say that's a real issue, though, as I find the flick perfectly comprehensible, its stylistic choices always serving the narrative instead of detracting from it. The movie is sprawling, domestic and somewhat wistful. It focuses on traditional romance, family dynamics and the struggles of women, viewing each aspect primarily through the rebellious eyes of Jo. Her three sisters do get distinct personalities and their fair share of screen-time, though. It's a tale of sisters, through and through. It's about their individual struggles to manoeuvre through a world that doesn't want them to be themselves, which you're always invested in. The acting is great across the board, with struggles strewn across faces and heartbreak seeping from unspoken words. The only issue with it is that some members of the core family are playing far younger than they have any right to be: Pugh's Amy, for example, is supposed to be thirteen for a large portion of the piece. Though the writing and acting do a good job of conveying youth, which contrasts well with the characters' eventual adulthoods, the casting simply isn't believable and it detracts from the experience. Other than that, though, the flick feels like it's exactly as it's supposed to be. It's confident, engaging and sometimes quite charming. It doesn't quite hit as hard as I'd like and it does feel very long, coming close to overstaying its welcome on quite a few occasions. It's never boring but it's often just passive entertainment. Still, it is entertainment. It's good enough and perhaps couldn't be any better. It's a solid effort. 6/10",positive
"The Lighthouse is one of the strangest films I've ever seen. Describing it or even knowing whether or not I liked it is pretty difficult. Suffice to say, it was is a very, very unique movie...one that is quite haunting and difficult.The story is set in the late 19th century and a lighthouse keeper (Willem Dafoe) and his assistant (Rob Pattinson) arrive at the facility for their tour of duty. At first, things seem pretty mundane, though over time they both seem to be losing their minds...Pattinson's character in particular. Where it goes from there is ugly, disturbing and weird.This is definitely NOT a film for everyone. In fact, I'd go so far as to say most people probably would not like the film....and fewer yet would really enjoy it. But it also is a wholly original viewing experience and I can respect the folks who made it. The acting is good....and it feels much like peeking inside the mind of a madman. Overall, not enjoyable but also pretty amazing.",positive
"THE LIGHTHOUSE is the latest spooky old lighthouse story which takes the true story of a mysterious disappearance in the late 19th century and uproots it to New England, where Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson are well cast as a couple of lighthouse keepers going out of their minds. I've seen numerous screen adaptations of this story in recent years, the best being the low budget monster flick COLD SKIN, but this one's a real bore by comparison. It's made by the guy who did THE WITCH - which I enjoyed, to a degree - and is a typical arthouse movie with zero storyline and close attention to stylistics and histrionic acting over any kind of depth. I found it a slog to sit through, an endless array of intense performances combined with a lack of narrative cohesion, structure, and storyline. The old ""going mad"" plot has been done to death and this adds nothing new, although Dafoe and Pattinson are good and it has a nice look to it at least.",negative
"Two lighthouse keepers arrive at an isolated island for a four week stint. Newcomer Thomas Howard (Robert Pattinson) is a former Canadian lumberjack. Thomas Wake (Willem Dafoe) is an one-legged veteran seafarer. Howard has to do all the heavy duties, dreams of a mermaid, and hounded by a seagull. Demanding Wake warns him of various superstitions.The first notable thing is the black and white photography with 1.19:1 aspect ratio. It is reminiscent of old timey movies dating back to the silent era. It fits very well with the mood and the setting. I like this up to the over-drinking. After that, the story gets crazier and crazier. I was expecting it to go supernatural. I can take some interspecies erotica. The Brokeback stuff comes out of nowhere. It becomes too experimental. The madness of the lighthouse booze is too much. The craziness dampens my enthusiasm a little bit.",negative
"So many have commented already, I'll keep it short. I remember when I saw ""Taxi Driver."" I was amazed at DeNiro's performance, the incredible visuals, and the wonderful direction. We watched a man fall into a darkness that none of us could possibly survive. But what i remember to this day is being dragged through the world the film presents. There is a line where it is thought that one should take a part of the city and pour concrete over it, destroying the sickness and covering it forever. As I watched the really amazing, frenetic performances in this film, I had some of the same feelings. I reached a point where I wanted cleanliness and daylight. The cruelty from the beginning that never dissipates is all once can hold. It's about human destruction in a claustrophobic world, a living hell.",positive
"Wileman Dafoe and Robert Pattinson are two lighthouse keepers on a small, isolated island off the coast of Maine - actually shot in Nova Scotia. As a storm rages about them, they go slowly mad.Robert Eggar's film is based in part on two Welsh lighthouse keepers in 1801, the Smalls Lighthouse tragedy. It is a peculiarly designed movie - Eggars, besides directing two movies, has worked on several other films as a production designer. The set is claustrophobic, the screen frame is just about square at 1.19:1, and the film is black and white. Dafoe uses an accent that is almost cartoonish, based on 19th century fishermen.It's a striking-looking film, that's for certain, but despite the acclaim it has received, I think these details are more likely to appeal to those with a technical understanding and appreciation of antediluvian film making. I was certainly fascinated, but I have my doubts that it will appeal to a general audience; despite its High Art merit, film remains a medium that must appeal to tens of millions to be deemed a success. While the revival of antique techniques and extinct accents may please the cognoscenti, it won't play in Peoria.",negative
"The Lighthouse is a US-American/Canadian co-production from 2019, so a really new film that was just released here this week, and it is the very first full feature film for writer and director Robert Eggers as the man in charge, even if film in general is nothing new to him. He has directed several short films and also worked in all kinds of departments, most prominently production design and costumes. It seems like he came up with the script here together with his brother Max. The outcome is this 110-minute movie that is set over a century ago. This may also explain why they decided for it to be made in black-and-white because the action is really set way in the past, but also because it is a really bleak movie and it certainly puts more emphasis on the essential plot. ""Essential"" is in general a good word to describe this one because the cast is also minimal. We have the two leads, a mermaid with almost no screen time and at the very beginning a few men who don't have an impact whatsoever.The two protagonists are played by Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe and I definitely want to say a few words about them. Dafoe I am a big fan of and I have read he is considered a potential Oscar nominee for his performance here, but in the supporting category. Now that does not make any sense at all. I mean he is not as much lead as Pattinson as we don't see him alone in scenes (which adds to the mystery surrounding his character), but there would be no movie without his character and he is absolutely lead. So is Pattinson. People who still seriously think he can't act because of Twilight need to reconsider. Or just watch more of his projects. He has been in so many quality films in recent years. Only one I want to mention is his Safdie Brothers film from not too long ago. Those two by the way could turn Adam Sandler into an Oscar nominee this year, but now I am drifting a bit away and that is not my intention. So back to ""The Lighthouse"". I generally would say I preferred Dafoe, but he also has the baitier material and it should definitely say nothing negative about Pattinson. He was really good too and probably hardly anybody could have given better portrayals than these two here. Actually, it was kinda shocking how here and there Pattinson was very difficult to recognize although he did not have the heavy beard make-up that Dafoe did. So also a good job from the make-up crew for sure and the way this film turned out I am 100% sure we will see more films from Eggers in the next years, even if I have a bit of a feeling this film could just be too weird and different for nominations at the Academy Awards. We will see.I don't want to say too much about the story because you see all that when you watch the film yourself. Still, this is the kind of film you can watch five times and most likely you still recognize something new and will be far from understanding it all. We have a duo of men, one old and one young starting their duty at a lighthouse. So far all normal. I mean the older one bullies the younger one a bit and makes it clear who's the boss and who has to do the hard work, but I guess Pattinson's character's fitness also makes this decision not too surprising. So the old guy basically only operates the light at the top, while the younger has to do all the cleaning, really physically hard work and also disgusting work. They are there for 4 weeks and at the end of this month, they actually grow a bit closer, share their real names and drink and have a bit of fun. But when for some reason the end of their term at this rock in the middle of nowhere is delayed because they do not get off the island and nobody replaces them, they stay there for longer and really turn insane eventually.There is a lot of talk about Pattinson's character's background and real identity, references to seagulls carrying the spirits of deceased sailors, which makes it a bad omen to kill a sea gull. And related to that, there is a really violent scene that includes the brutal killing of a seagull. I must say that was painful to watch for me, actually more painful almost than the scene near the ending when we witness what happens to Dafoe's character and I guess that says it all how much I like animals. But yeah, the gulls get their revenge at the end as the young protagonist's plan to be in charge of the light up there also results in his death eventually. I think this scene up there with the light was really hauntingly horrifying and very well done with light, darkness, camera angles and everything, also Pattinson's looks there with madness all over him. And Eggers does not give us this one slightly positive moment at all to close the film with when Pattinson's character is up there having achieved his goal. Not a chance. He gives us the looks of his intestines being mauled by wild animals after probably breaking pretty much every single bone in his body when he crashes down the stairs. So it is a horror film, there is no denying. And while there was a lot I liked about this film and not too much I didn't like, I am still hesitant in saying there was anything I really loved (except the two performances perhaps). So this explains my rating of 3 stars out of 5, which is not too bad and not too great. But this is definitely one of the darkest and at the same time most different films from 2019, maybe too different for me, so my rating is definitely subjective. There is not too much to argue against here from an objective point of view.In general, I could say a lot more about this one, but it feels that sadly I forgot quite a bit already since seeing it last night. It is an extremely atmospheric film of course. The isolated setting is perfect for the film's tone and everything related to it. Oh yeah, one thing you can never be really sure about in this film is what is real and what just exists basically in Patterson's character's mind. They are even toying with the audience when Dafoe's character says something that he himself is just an imagination in the young man's mind and he is somewhere in the Canadian woods having critical illusions. Then the mermaid scenes of course, the idea that he found the man who helped Dafoe's character in the past, how they absolutely have no idea how long they have been on the island. You never know what's real and what not. Aside from that, i.e. the scary moments, it is not a film that you want to watch with your young children because it is downright scary at times. The alive burial near the end is horrifying also the actual killing moments later. I mentioned the gull scene already. Then there is also some sexual explicitness in here. We see breasts and also very vaguely indicated intercourse and masturbation. Apart from that, there is a great deal of swearing although that I always find harmless.Another thing I found interesting was to find out what was written in the logbook. Did he have mercy on the young man and gave him a good report? Not at all. And that makes things escalate even further because it was all about being paid and clearly that was the only reason why Pattinson's character was on the island, the longer the film went even more so because it was just more and more a haven of horrors. And pay attention to how we find out they have the same first name, maybe a metaphor to indicate that at their very core they are not too different from each other. And despite the early scenes, you really should not mistake the young Tom for a good character here. They are basically both evil eventually. Remember what happened with the real Winslow. The young Tom is just forced to follow orders, but you can clearly see his violent tendencies several times, like when he approaches the old Tom ready to cut his throat while asleep. And it is also never 100% safe how much of all this is really insanity. Actually you could make a statement for Dafoe's character just being cruel and not really having lost his sanity. Okay, I guess I could write another three paragraphs about this film because it is packed with symbolisms, metaphors and interesting elements that make a relatively simple story fairly interesting. But I will not. Instead I want to encourage you to head to your nearest theater and watch this film. Or watch it at home, preferably when it is dark outside (and inside) because everything else just wouldn't fit the film's tone. I still think it is a much better watch on the big screen, so go for it. It's a thumbs-up for me as expected.",positive
"The Lighthouse is one of the most original, stylish, ambiguous and open to interpretation films recently released in the theaters. The originality and stylish begin with the black and white and screen size, with a theatrical story of madness that keeps the attention of the viewer until the last scene. The ambiguity is reflected in the different favorable opinions that we can find in Internet showing that the movie is open to interpretation. In addition, the performances of Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe are impressive. Last but not the least, ""The Lighthouse"" is the typical film that deserves to be watched more than once. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""O Farol"" (""The Lighthouse"")",positive
"For much of The Lighthouse, I was not wholly sure what was going on, which I guess is deliberate as it is never quite clear what is what. What is consistent though is the sense of dread and claustrophobia that comes from the limits of the location and the fear of this unknown threat - whatever it may be. This is not quite good enough to carry the film for its full 110 minutes, because it is a bit too long, but it is enough to grab the viewer and more or less keep them there until the end - more or less.The narrative isn't much to talk about, but the tone and tension is what works - if it works for you. The manner of delivery of this is an oppressive approach, making the viewer feel uncomfortable and not giving space to get away from it. I thought this aspect of it was done well in many different ways. The selection of the ratio, keeping the shot tight no matter what shot it was; the noise of the sea and sight of the waves; but even the dialogue - which was distracting in some ways but effective in others. The fruity accents and gruff delivery makes it hard to catch every word, but it did cause me to lean in. The performances come with an intensity and realism that sells the film even when so much of it is hard to accept on the face of it.I do think that for a lot of viewers it will be a reasonable reaction to be put off the film - mainly because feeling uncomfortable for several hours is not an easy experience to sell. For myself I felt a bit of that - at the end that I more appreciated what it did well and how it did it than I actually 'enjoyed' the film as a film. One of those where I'm glad I watched it but am really unlikely to ever watch it again.",positive
"Thomas Wake (Robert Pattinson ) attempts to maintain his sanity being alone in a lighthouse with William Defoe, who smells, talks, and drinks like a pirate. In black and white as a way to say this is an art film and doesn't need to be good or make sense. The acting and soliloquies were great, although after a while you realize this isn't going anywhere.Guide: F-word, sex, nudity (Valeriia Karaman )",negative
"Well not literally speaking ... although, who am I to say that isn't the case? Especially with not at least 10 viewings. What I am trying to say is, that this movie will leave a lot of things unanswered. Saying you have to be watchful and follow what is going on would be a massive understatememnt.The movie gives you hints and clues as to what it is trying to do and tell you. But it also is leaving it up to you to see what you want to see. Who is who, and where are they/him/it? This is a great example in minimalism. It also will be a stretch for those watching - do you mind the ratio (4:3), do you mind it is black and white, do you mind the small cast? Or do you relish in the story, in the craziness, in the depths of human isolation and what can occur in ones mind? What triggers what and what helps or doesn't? What is reality?",positive
"Bleak and brooding, ""The Lighthouse"" is a study of the descent into madness of two lighthouse keepers, stranded beyond their original four week assignment, and despairing in the fate of their existence together. Thomas Wake (Willem Dafoe) and Tom Howard (Robert Pattinson) are alternately at each others' throats or gleefully imbibing their way into a state of stupor, at one point suggesting a homoerotic encounter, but quickly devolving into yet another fit of pique. Of the two, it's Pattinson's character who eventually experiences visions and nightmares as he goes about his daily chores, subservient to the demands of his nominal supervisor Wake. Cinematically, the picture reminded me of all those great black and white films of the Thirties and Forties emanating from the silent era. It even has a 'B' quality look, though the subject matter goes beyond the simplistic efforts of early film, and challenges the viewer with a myriad of interpretations one could assign to the story. That the fate of the two men ends so tragically is no wonder given the exposition, and you'll come away convinced that it's bad luck to kill a seabird.",positive
"If it wasn't for the nominations received Awards Season, and the two well-known leading actors, I'm not sure if this was a film I would have rushed out to see, but I did read about it also, and it sounded intriguing, directed by Robert Eggers (The Witch). Basically, set in the late 19th century, Ephraim Winslow (Robert Pattinson) is sent on a boat to an isolated island off the coast of New England, to serve a four-week contract job as a wickie. He is under the supervision of irritable elderly fellow lighthouse keeper Thomas Wake (Willem Dafoe). The following few days is filled with back-breaking work and unfavourable conditions, and the tight-lipped men will have no one else for company except for each other, forced to endure irritating idiosyncrasies, bottled-up resentment, and burgeoning hatred. Winslow observes Wake going up to the lighthouse's lantern room at night and stripping naked. Winslow begins experiencing visions and dreams of tentacles in the lighthouse, tree stumps floating in the water, and distant images of a mermaid (Valeriia Karamän). Over time, Wake demands Winslow take the more taxing jobs, including refuelling the light, carrying heavy kerosene containers, and disposing of the two men's chamber pots. Whilst outside, Winslow repeatedly encounters a one-eyed gull, but Wake warns him it is bad luck to kill a gull, as he is superstitious that the animals are reincarnated sailors. The weeks continue, and Winslow masturbates to a figurine of a mermaid and continues to see Wake naked. One night at dinner, the two get to know each other and discuss Wake's previous second wickie, who Wake says died shortly after going insane. The day before Winslow is scheduled to leave, he notices the water pump is releasing bloody water and investigates. He checks the cistern to see a dying gull floating inside. The one-eyed seagull returns and attacks Winslow, hr grabs the bird and beats it to death against the cistern. The winds dramatically change direction during the afternoon, and when a storm hits the island the two men get drunk. The next morning, the ferry does not arrive, and Winslow sees a body washed up on the shore. He approaches the naked body and flees in shock seeing that it is a mermaid. Back at the cottage, rations were impacted by the storm, and the crate supposedly containing extra rations only contain more alcohol. More nights progress, and the storm continues, and the two men grow closer while remaining adversaries toward each other. Winslow is curious about what is in the lantern room at the top of the lighthouse and unsuccessfully tries to steal the key to it from a sleeping Wake. He has visions of a lobster trap containing the severed, half-blinded head of Wake's previous wickie. One night, Winslow tells Wake that his real name is Thomas Howard and that he assumed the identity of Ephraim Winslow (Logan Hawkes) who died in an accident. Wake accuses Howard of ""spilling his beans,"" and Howard tries to leave. He attempts to escape in a lifeboat, but in madness Wake destroys it with an axe, which he chases him with, until he is calmed down. With no alcohol left, the two begin mixing spirits out of turpentine and honey, and the powerful storm waves crash through the windows of the cottage. After Howard looks through Wake's log, he confronts Wake about his work performance and accuses him of mental abuse and begs to see the light that he is seemingly keeping him from. Wake berates Howard, and Howard attacks him. While seeing visions of the mermaid, Wake as a sea monster, and the real Winslow, Howard beats Wake until he unconscious. Using a rope, Howard drags Wake's body and buries him alive in the ration pit. Howard takes the keys and prepares to go up to the lantern room, but Wake appears and hits him in the shoulder with the axe. Howard disarms Wake with a kettle pot, grabs the axe and kills him. He then ascends the lighthouse staircase to the lantern house. He approaches the Fresnel lens, and it stops and opens. Howard gazes into the mirrored interior in ecstasy and reaches his arm inside. Then the light suddenly brightens, he lets out a distorted scream, the light gets brighter and his scream (unheard) louder, until he slips, falling down the steps and breaks his leg. It ends with Howard lying naked on the rocks, missing an eye and with several gulls pecking his innards, eating him alive. Also starring Kyla Nicolle as Woman on the Rocks, Shaun Clarke as Departing Wickie and Pierre Richard as Departing Assistant Wickie. Apart from characters seen in part, including the monstrous mermaid, this is mainly a two-hander movie, with Dafoe as the superstitious veteran and Pattison as the younger man assisting manning the beacon. Throughout the film, the atmosphere is dark, strange and unpredictable, you are anxious that either character could crack as their sanity fades and hatred increases, and the eerie things seen in terrifying visions captivate you, and the camerawork is very good, a disturbing but most interesting psychological horror. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Cinematography, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Cinematography. Good!",positive
"I finally got the chance to sit down and watch the 2019 movie ""The Lighthouse"" from director and writer Robert Eggers. And I must admit that it was with a great level of expectation that I did so, because I had heard nothing but praise and good things about the movie.First of all, personally I think having shot the movie in black and white wasn't a great move, because a lot of details were lost in the lack of color, and I just don't overly enjoy watching black and white movies in general. But this was a minor nuisance.I will say that the movie was really nicely carried by both leads, that being Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson. Initially I had some doubt about Robert Pattinson being able to pull a movie like this off with grace, but wow, he sure did. He definitely has cast aside that horrible mantle that was the sparkling vampire of ""Twilight"".The characters in the movie were nicely detailed and given lots of personalities and quirks. And both Dafoe and Pattinson really gave their heart and soul in the performances, and it bore fruit well in favor of the movie.The dialogue in the movie is just splendid. Especially the dialogue given to Thomas Wake - the character portrayed by Willem Dafoe.It should be said that ""The Lighthouse"" is not your average movie, not even remotely. This is a bizarre movie and a very unique movie for sure. And I don't think that it will fall well in favor with everyone in the audience. This is a very detailed and vivid descent into madness. And the movie even have a hint of Lovecraftian atmosphere, which I enjoyed.I had expected more from the movie, given all the praise it had been receiving. Sure, this was an enjoyable and entertaining movie, but it just fell short of my expectations somehow.My rating for ""The Lighthouse"" is a six out of ten stars.",negative

"After making a big splash with his creepy horror film ""The Witch: A New-England Folktale"", co-writer / director Robert Eggers takes us on a similarly gloomy journey. It's largely a study of two very distinct characters, with the added aspect of full-blown psychological horror and an incredible onslaught of nightmarish imagery. It won't be to all tastes, but people eager to check out a dark descent into madness will find it endlessly interesting and entertaining.Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson play Thomas and ""Ephraim"", two lighthouse keepers assigned to a remote, rocky location in New England of the 1890s. The two don't get along very well from the get-go, so you can imagine how thick the tension is going to get as their relationship gets more and more antagonistic. Each man will come to believe that the other is capable of just about anything, including murder.Ever-reliable veteran Dafoe completely disappears inside his character, an ultra-crusty and ultra-salty old dog who's fond of tale-spinning. Pattinson is just as creditable in another performance that helps to further distance himself from his breakthrough role as Edward in the ""Twilight"" series. And, for a while, these are the only two characters in the story, with occasional appearances by a mermaid played by the striking Valeriia Karaman.It's great fun to watch Dafoe and Pattinson butt heads, and the antiquated dialogue flows from Dafoe's mouth with the greatest of ease. (Eggers and co-writer Max Eggers draw their inspiration from the writings of Herman Melville, Sarah Orne Jewett, and the journals of actual lighthouse keepers.) This dialogue is so colourful that it can be downright priceless.All in all, this viewer can see how some viewers might find this film pretentious, but he found it an agreeable melding of conventional horror tropes with more arthouse-type aspirations. It's grim, it's ominous, and despite the laughs to be had, it rarely offers the audience a respite from the darkness on display.Filmed on location in Nova Scotia, Canada.Eight out of 10.",positive
"Willem Dafoe & Robert Pattison deliver strong performances in this gripping tale of life stranded on a remote island where they keep a lighthouse. The latter starts off as a more responsible, sensible character in the face of his uncouth, bullying, alcoholic companion but as we develop, we see the influence on Pattinson soon becomes more toxic and we descend into a psychological drama where nothing/no-one makes a lot of sense. The monochrome photography adds greatly to the eeriness of the production; the dark skies; sweeping seascapes; torrid weather conditions - and the story combines nautical myths and superstitions with human frailties in a compelling fashion. It's a film about two people - there isn't any definable storyline, or structure - it evolves in an entirely fluid manner that adds much to the tension and makes it well worth a watch (ideally on a big screen).",positive
"In the 1890s a young man joins a lighthouse on a four-week shift. It is his first time working in a lighthouse and his partner and leader is a veteran of many years at the lighthouse. From the outset his boss treats him very badly, leading to much animosity between the two. Will they get through the four weeks without a violent confrontation?Great psychological drama. From the start there is a brooding, simmering atmosphere which intensifies throughout the movie as the tension between the two men escalates. Writer-director Robert Eggers builds the tension well and pulls the strings very deftly in terms of manipulating viewers.The psychological aspect is fairly well done, with themes of insanity and paranoia that are reminiscent of Joseph Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness'.All this is helped by brilliant cinematography that creates the perfect atmosphere for the plot. Filmed in black and white some of the scenes and shots are stunning in their execution. Jarin Blaschke received a Best Cinematography Oscar nomination for his work (the film's only Oscar nomination). The bleakness of the setting helps too.One misgiving I had about this film before watching it was that it starred Robert Pattinson, he of Twilight fame. Pattinson actually does a really good job here and doesn't detract from the film at all. Willem Dafoe is great as the other protagonist.Great film.",positive
"2019 is officially the year of the freak out movie. ""Joker,"" ""Parasite,"" ""Midsommar,"" ""Her Smell,"" just to name a few. And now ""The Lighthouse.""Robert Pattinson freaks out like nobody's business in this technically amazing and incredibly atmospheric fable set on a bleak seashore. He's a young man running from some unsavory doings in his past, while Willem Dafoe is a kind of Captain Ahab of lighthouses, a salty caricature of a seafaring fellow who asserts his authority early and often. This set up gradually devolves into a bizarro thriller with mythical overtones as Pattinson's character begins to lose his mind and hurtles toward a violent showdown of macho wills with his older partner.I don't know that I'll see a more visually impressive film this year. Filmed in glorious black and white with a square aspect ratio, the film looks like it comes from an older era, but it's a technical marvel. The production and sound design combined with the moody cinematography make the environment of the film palpable to the audience. You can almost smell the sea air, feel the biting drafts, taste the rotgut both characters are constantly swilling. I was a little disappointed as the film wore on that it becomes progressively more like a fable than an actual story grounded in reality. Fables just seem dramatically unsatisfying to me, since everything is meant to represent something else, and characters are used at the service of a moral rather than given full dimensional life. After this movie ended, I found myself wanting a bit more from it.But the performances are extremely good, and they, combined with the visual and auditory merits, make the movie more than worth sitting through. While watching the film, it's easy to think that Pattinson is the one who's acting the hell out of it, as he gets the showier role. But in retrospect, it's Defoe who's the most memorable.Grade: A",positive
"Greetings again from the darkness. The opening sequence plays like something from 1920's era cinema. The chug-chug-chug of a boat slamming against the waves of an angry sea while birds flap and chirp alongside. We hear the wind and ""feel"" the severe ocean spray. Several minutes elapse before any word is spoken. Immediately noticeable is the nearly square aspect ratio ... the rarely (these days) seen 1.19:1 frame, making the black and white images appear both surreal and ominous.All of the above makes perfect sense when we realize this is writer-director Robert Eggers' first feature film since his 2015 indie horror gem THE WITCH won dozens of festival awards. Mr. Eggers obviously has his own vision for projects, and his approach borders on experimental, eschewing conventional. He co-wrote this script with his brother Max, and evidently much was drawn from the actual journals of lighthouse keepers ... something that is evident in the vocabulary and the effects of solitude.4-time Oscar nominee Willem Dafoe stars alongside Robert Pattison as the two men charged with a 4 week assignment of tending to a lighthouse. The film is set in 1890, and Dafoe plays Thomas Wake, the epitome of a salty old sea dog, replete with bad leg, hardcore Atlantic accent, and upside down pipe. Pattinson is Ephraim Winslow, the assistant Wickie, who faces non-stop demands from Wake, and initially maintains a quietness as he goes about his duties ... what Wake calls the 'doldrums.' We learn little about either man's past. For Wake, other than knowing his previous assistant went mad, the clue is when he mentions ""13 Christmases spent at sea"" costing him a family. For Ephraim, when Wake asks, ""Tell me what's a timberman want with being a Wickie?"" we get some insight into Ephraim's desired future.Eggers has delivered the anti-buddy movie. It's a bleak, slow-motion race to insanity caused by being isolated with only one other person ... a person you aren't fond of. Only this is not a director or a film content with showing two men stuck on a storm-battered rock, as they slip towards insanity. No, we viewers are forced to experience some of these same feelings - how much of what we see is actually happening? It's mesmerizing and hypnotic, and the above-mentioned narrow screen aspect purposefully emphasizes the sense of confinement and claustrophobia.With no color and only a couple of characters ... OK, 3 if you count the mermaid ...OK, 4 if you count the seagull ... the film still manages to pound us with sensory overload. We can barely process all we are seeing, despite relatively minimal 'typical' action. The black and white images are mostly just various shades of gray, and sunshine is non-existent. Cinematographer Jarin Blaschke (THE WITCH) embraces the dreariness by allowing the fog, lanterns, candles, wind, rain, and harsh elements to become characters unto themselves. However, nothing is in sync with our two leads. Composer Mark Korven fills the many lapses in dialogue with sounds and tones we haven't heard before, yet they fit perfectly here. This is also quite likely the first film to utilize farts and foghorns in harmony.Director Eggers filmed this on Cape Forchu in Nova Scotia, and the extreme weather and less-than-welcoming terrain create quite the visuals - as do the faces of our two lead actors. Dafoe may never have chewed scenery so delightfully as he does here, and Pattinson starts slowly before delivering his best work - including a ferocious rant that is fascinating to watch and contrast to his character's first meal with Dafoe. Is this a horror film? A fantasy? Macabre comedy? There is simply no way to describe this other than bizarre. It's truly miserable cinema, and I loved every minute of it.",positive

But there was really no excuse for the pretentiousness of the b/w academy ratio shooting, or if there was I missed it.

"Aside from a few very marketable films like ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" and ""Aladdin"", Guy Ritchie is a writer/director who makes incredibly violent films. That is, incredibly violent films which are also brilliantly constructed and near perfect. While I rarely ever watch violent films, I eagerly look for his next dark British crime film, after seeing his ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch""....and so it's not surprising I'd see ""The Gentlemen"". And, like these other films, it's near perfect...and a film you ought to see if you have the stomach for this sort of story.So this leads me to a huge warning. This is NOT a family-friendly film nor one you want to show your mother or Father Jenkins if he stops by for a visit. There's ample cursing, loads of violence, vomit galore, and the story is about bad people...very bad people.The story is complicated...and goes together like a finely crafted puzzle. It concerns a marijuana czar in Britain, Michael Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) and his desire to sell out and retire to a life of ease and sophistication. However, after making an offer to a rival drug kingpin, suddenly everything goes haywire....folks start dying, farms growing the stuff are hit and an all-out war seems inevitable. There's WAY more to the story than this...but since it's so complex, it's best you just see it to appreciate it.The bottom line is that Guy Ritchie can write and direct amazing films...and this one is truly amazing and entertaining. Apart from his misguided vanity project, ""Swept Away"", his output has been impressive and I cannot stress enough what a quality product this film is. My only MINOR quibble is what about the Russian mobster.....what happens with him? This isn't really dealt with in the film and seems a bit like a dangling plot point.",positive
"Having witnessed the cinematic abominations put out by Guy Ritchie since his last decent movie - 2000's SNATCH - I wasn't expecting much from THE GENTLEMEN and I didn't get it, either. It's a throwback to his gangster flicks of yesteryear, but cruder, dumber and more generic than ever. The plot is updated to modern times with smart phones, street gangs and rap, but it's just mindlessly convoluted, deeply unfunny, profane, and seems to go on and on with no end in sight. Hugh Grant's narrator is more caricature than character, and the only decent performances come from Charlie Hunnam and Colin Farrell; literally the only decent things in this.",negative
"Fletcher (Hugh Grant) is a sleazy private investigator trying to sell info and a script to Raymond Smith (Charlie Hunnam), the right hand man of weed kingpin Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey). Mickey is married to Rosalind (Michelle Dockery) and has a network of grow ops operating out of a dozen estates of British nobility. He's trying to sell his business to Matthew Berger (Jeremy Strong). Dry Eye (Henry Golding) is a ruthless ambitious drug dealer. Coach (Colin Farrell) is a youth boxing coach.This Guy Ritchie film is chock full of the Ritchie style. Every character has the brash Ritchie gangster style. Something is missing which made it a start and stop watch for me. I come to realize that I don't care about any of the characters. It starts with the structure which is unreliable narrator Fletcher telling the story to Raymond (who should already know most of it anyways). Hunnam is playing an unemotional henchman. Otherwise, he should be the perfect rooting interest. There is no reason for Fletcher to recount the whole story other than a movie reason. Raymond already knows most of the story making the film a waiting game for his character. It saps the tension out of the twists and turns. I do wonder if it would be more compelling to play it straight. This is very much a straight up Ritchie film and his fans will root for it. I had a tougher time.",negative
"Matthew McConaughey, who has become one of the major players in the British weed trade through science, paying poor noblemen to let him stash his farms on their property, and a judicious amount of leg-breaking, thinks it's time to retire. He offers to sell his business to a fellow entrepreneur for £400,000,000, but other people in the illegal fun trade have their own agendas.Guy Ritchie has returned to his early themes of violence, chaos, and rock&roll from his early career, and has scored a definite hit, with some fine performances, including a blank-faced one by Charlie Hunnam and an outsized comedy turn by Colin Farrell. Hugh Grant does well as the unwanted on-screen narrator of events, putting them into some order; I am impressed by his lack of a posh accent, event as I wished Ritchie had been able to think of a better way of telling the audience the story.Even with that cavil, the unceasing action and insanity kept me more than interested throughout.",positive
"The Gentlemen is the newest movie by director Guy Ritchie, who is also one of the three writers here and is nowadays still not only known for his movies, but also for the fact that he was once married to Madonna. This film runs for approximately 110 minutes and looking at it in detail, I would say that his approach and the outcome in terms of style and pretty much everything else is the same like it was 20 years ago for him. It's very frequently style over substance. The fact how over the top the story may be is not too important if there are constantly cool quotes, spectacular characters and outrageous events happening. The best example is the kid falling out of the window. Or that there are rails where the Asian guy falls down and that this very second also a train arrives. Or his name of course and the many jokes about this are also a prime example. But it also results in a lot of fun. I just mentioned Aslan falling out of the window already. Now that entire scene was hilarious with Hunnam's character and the kids there and the two strong folks too of course. And also after he falls out of the window when we see Hunnam run after the boys (or one of them), then have a conflict with them, then pull his gun. And so on. Also how one of the two brutes deals with the situation and we see it just like Hunnam's character does. All accompanied by some of the smartest and most hilarious dialogues out there.I think Hunnam was my favorite from the cast here. And that means something because it is a really good cast. He is growing more and more on me. I still wonder if his character is actually a cannibal, if he is eating what he seems to be eating near the end? And if yes, then if he knew what he was eating? Namely a juicy piece of prey meat handed to him from the boss lion to his most precious aide? Anyway, my praise for Hunnam means even more because folks like Grant, Marsan and McConaughey are actors I also like a lot. Not to mention that Farrell, Dockery and a few other experienced and highly successful actors are on board here. I somehow feel that with this cast at his disposal, Ritchie could have come up with something better. But it is really all almost pointless fun from beginning to end. Of course there are also sexual references, but the most ""worrying"" is the great deal of violence here. Also not just that it happens, but how it happens. It is sometimes pretty extreme. Take the meat references towards the end. Or how it starts right away as we see McConaughey's character at a restaurant just having a tea or coffee or so and then somebody comes and shoots him in the head. Well, at least it seemed that way. Reality is different as we find out later on. But it could have happened like this because all we see afterwards for over 60 minutes after this little opening takes place before said opening. Other than that, it's a fairly chronological movie.McConaughey seems like the protagonist early on, the lion as he calls himself, but the longer the film goes, the more it turns into an ensemble performance really and there are long sequences that do not feature him at all, even if at the very end, he is back again as strong as possible and he almost looks like a lion there, too strong maybe even because at some point, it just felt like a film that tried his best to show us the most hopeless situations for McConaughey's character and how he always manages to get out of them. Often through mere luck. It is just really absurd. Hunnam's character arriving on time at the restaurant was still alright, but how the boxer kids open fire and kill the two Russian gangsters in the front seats was just too ridiculous honestly. Or also how Farrell's character kills those at Hunnam's character's house. I must say I struggled a bit with Farrell's role in general, already his very first scene when he shows these boys how he is physically and intellectually superior there. Prime example of the aforementioned style over substance. Oh well. Then again I am not a big fan anymore as I was years ago when it comes to Farrell.The one actor I like more is Hugh Grant (he has steadily risen in my perception and was Oscar-worthy in ""Florence Foster Jenkins"" not too long ago), so I was a bit disappointed that he is basically only used for the framework here and a bit of a blackmail story because honestly I could have done without this part completely. He is not needed to tell the story, even if he has his fun moments too like how he comes from the bathroom when the two gangsters arrive with Aslan's corpse. But as a whole, he could have added a lot more if his character had been written more convincingly. At the end, how he ends up in that box and still has this revelation to share about Aslan's dad and the consequences coming with it and how it all happens at the same time is also really exaggerared. I did not like it too much. At the end, he seems free, but nope not yet, he is again in Hunnam's character' car. When Grant's character gives the script to Miramax (also the actual producer here of course), he implies there could be a sequel to his ideas, which certainly can be understood in a way that this film here could also get a sequel. Also fairly fun how people in his story at the end end up in cars under dangerous circumstances while also he ends up in a car in a situation he desperately wants to get out of. Will he live or die? We also will see in a sequel perhaps. I think this one here was good enough for me to check out a sequel if they ever make one. I hope they use another awesome song for the opening credits there just like they did here (""Cumberland Gap""). Had to download immediately when I was home. I hope such a sequel features Hunnam's character prominently then, maybe even more at the center of the story than he was here.Okay, what else can I say about this film. I was really tired at the beginning, so maybe this is why I felt that it needed a while to become a good film. Or I don't know, maybe it never turned into a good film, but just a funny, fairly creative one. The core story is really easy to criticize with how absurd it turns out at times (also the complete absence of police) and I am not one bit surprised that critics apparently did not like the film too much from what I have read. I probably could write another two paragraphs, most likely more, only filled with cool quotes here, but I won't. Instead I say: Go watch the film yourself and I am positive you will smile or even laugh a lot. Also about the absurd comedy. Even when there is talk about a guy being locked in a gigantic freezer, it is somewhat funny. Enough said. Tarantino will perhaps like it too. Let's just hope the guy in the freezer will not have a similar fate like Aslan('s corpse). Oh well, then again I did not like him too much either, the guy in the freezer I mean, the Jew with his crabs that is, perhaps also because of his introduction early on. Later on, he was slightly more interesting, but there it was also basically McConaughey just doing all the work in the scene with him. Oh and Eddie Marsan yes, I have to mention him because I really adore the actor. Now his scene with the pigs and the implications what happened (luckily they spare us the visual side) were just so wrong and yet hilarious. Nice to see Marsan getting to work with some really big stars here. In that scene, or the aftermath, even Farrell's comments were truly hilarious about how they could never unsee what happened there. They should have named the pig Napoléon though, no idea how they forgot about this reference.Okay, this is all then I suppose. I give the movie a thumbs-up for sure and recommend checking it out. Could have been 10-15 minutes shorter though if they had left out some of the weaker parts or the entire frame story (and given Grant a better role). Even there, when they try to be smart, like with the wire in the shoes, it is never ""Knives Out"" level. Still, it's worth 110 minutes of your time, especially if you like most of the actors as much as I do. What I do have to say though is that in terms of character writing, Ritchie still has to win me over that he can also come up with high-quality female characters. Sure, it is difficult in a world of organized crime, but Dockery definitely is not it here. The young girl at the apartment that they are supposed to bring home is even more interesting although she has like 10% of Dockery's screen time. At least in terms of items Dockery delivers. That tiny golden gun is really cool and also the references to it being just a paperweight. Okay, now that is really all. I think you could say that ""cool"" is the perfect word to describe the movie, even if it certainly is also a bit on the shallow side.",positive

However a Chinese gangster wants to muscle in on the deal and finds the location of one of Mickey's manor where the weed is grown.Raymond is told a story one evening by private investigator Fletcher (Hugh Grant) who has been hired by a tabloid editor to investigate Mickey.Ritchie must have thought that if Quentin Tarantino can go back to the same well, so can he.

"Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) grows and sells pot in England. Perhaps not the best gangster business to be in, but they make it look good. Fletcher (Hugh Grant) is a private investigator who claims to have the goods on Mickey. He is discussing the details of the shakedown with Ray (Charlie Hunnam), Mickey's right-hand man. The film story is told as flashbacks. In the opening cliche teaser scene it appears Mickey is shot, but we know that can't be so because this feature follows too many film formulas, so we see the ""twists"" coming including who set up the raid on Mickey.It wasn't a bad film except I didn't like how it jumped. It introduced too many players. The whole pot idea didn't fly, but as a tough guy film, it was all right.Guide; F-word. brief rape. No nudity.",negative
"Yes, I am tempted to say he's back. It's not that he went away or didn't have at least some decent movies over the last few years. I haven't seen Aladdin, but it was succesful sort of. But this is right up his alley! This is pure and enjoyable Guy Ritchie, with timeline cuts and jumps and characters that one may think only he can write.It's so great to see Matthew McConaughey joining the ranks, being a substitue for Jason Statham I reckon. But also having Hugh Grant in this ... role/character. Genius! Who'd have thunk it, and he kills it (no pun intended). At least a few twists will be easy to spot, but I don't think one can guess everything. Even so, the movie is so well made, it won't really matter. If you like the genre, this is the one to watch. Fun and thrilling to the end ...",positive
"Any Guy Ritchie film I've seen, he always delivers, especially when he's writer and director. This one follows in the tradition of ""Rocknrolla"", ""Snatch"", and ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", the story layered with multiple sets of gangsters trying to outdo each other for the grand prize at the end of the flick. I got a kick out of the opening scene in which the bartender pouring Michael Pearson's (Matthew McConaughey) pint pulls down on the bar tap handle reading 'Ritchie Sewing Company', a self promoting piece of business I found pretty clever.This one doesn't seem to be as hard to follow as the earlier mentioned films. All of them prompted a second viewing to catch all the nuance of the characters, but this one, even with the chronology going back and forth, was pretty straightforward. That's probably due to the format, essentially a narration of events by journalist Fletcher (Hugh Grant) relating his investigative work to Pearson's right hand man, bodyguard and driver Raymond (Charlie Hunnam). Colin Farrell's character is simply known as 'Coach', and he's drawn into the story by virtue of his gangsta underlings botching a take down of one of Pearson's weed farms. What could have been an ancillary character winds up being central to the outcome of the story.And just about when you think it's over, another twist occurs with the introduction of a Russian oligarch and his mission of revenge for the death of his son. All the while you have to wonder how the picture's principal character, that would be Pearson, manages to come out of the story intact, considering all the bad guys who want to do him in. It's a fun watch if you go for this kind of stuff, made all the merrier by the script's creative use of the English language. You know, maybe I will watch this all over again.",positive
"When it comes to films directed by Guy Ritchie (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch), they can be hit and misses, with big misses including Swept Away, Revolver, Sherlock Holmes, and King Arthur, but the trailer for this film looked worth a try, even just for the star of Four Wedding and Love Actually playing completely against his usual type. Basically, American businessman Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) has formed a highly profitable marijuana empire in London and across England. The drugs kingpin is looking to cash out his business, and when the words gets out, several schemes, bribes and blackmails are triggered in an attempt to steal his domain. It is reported that Pearson has been shot dead, and private eye and aspiring screenwriter Fletcher (Hugh Grant) is employed by a newspaper to investigate. He visits Pearson's right-hand man Ray (Nicholas Nickleby's Charlie Hunnam) and threatens to expose the empire, he tells a full-length detailed backstory of the origins of the business, up until the present. This includes the many hidden marijuana plantations across the countryside, and Pearson's wife Rosalind (Downton Abbey's Michelle Dockery) being part of key decisions. Fletcher also details the many characters behind the scenes, including Coach (Colin Farrell), or trying to take it away, including Dry Eye (Henry Golding). The British crime underworld is close to exposure, but all is not as it seems, and Pearson may not actually be dead. Also starring Jeremy Strong as Cannabis King Matthew, Eddie Marsan as Mike, Jason Wong and Phuc and Jordan Long as Barman. McConaughey gives a good performance as the yank head honcho, there is good support from Hunnam, Dockery and Golding, but this film is pretty much taken by Grant, who with his cockney accent, goatee beard and sunglasses outshines all. It is nice of Ritchie to return his geezers gangsters and guns origins, but let's be honest, it is a bit of a rehash of what we've seen before, the dialogue is witty, there are amusing moments, and the editing is clever, but overall it just feels meh, an average action crime drama. Okay!",negative
"Having spent a decade or so making Hollywood blockbusters (with varying degrees of success), director Guy Ritchie returns to the genre that first made him famous: Tarantino à la UK. Some might see this as a backwards step, but in my opinion, it's what he does best.This time around, the ace in Ritchie's hand is Hugh Grant, who brilliantly plays pivotal character Fletcher, a tabloid reporter who tries to blackmail powerful drug lord Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), threatening to publish an extremely damaging story if he doesn't receive a payment of £20m within 72 hours. The film unfolds as Fletcher tells Pearson's right hand man Ray (Charlie Hunnam) the story of how he gathered the dirt on his boss. Grant's performance is pure genius: playing against type he is seriously sleazy and frequently hilarious.Not that the rest of the cast are any slouches: Hunnam is cool and badass, Colin Farrell displays a keen comedic touch as tough gym owner Coach, McConaughey is his usual affable self (but with a seriously dangerous edge), Michelle Dockery impresses as Pearson's spunky wife Rosalind, and Jeremy Strong holds his own as the criminal who wants to buy Pearson's marijuana operation. Even the minor characters are great as well, from the Coach's grime-loving lads 'TheToddlers' to the obnoxious housing estate yoofs who give Ray's 'muscle' the runaround.Ritchie's writing and direction is possibly his best yet, the script sparkling with wit and the visuals both stylish and confident. The dialogue is extremely funny (and loaded with expletives), the violence gloriously OTT, and the characters memorable. It might be a case of Ritchie 'playing it safe' by revisiting familiar territory, but when the result is as entertaining as this, why the hell not?",positive
"This is a typical Guy Ritchie movie, there is a story, it isn't always easy to follow, but style is even more important. Matthew McConaughey is American Mickey Pearson who went to England as a young man on a Rhodes Scholarship. He soon learned that he had a knack for selling drugs to fellow students and that eventually blossomed into his vocation on a very broad scale. Now in middle age has decided to sell his marijuana empire, which included a dozen well-hidden farms, and retire to a leisurely life and maybe have a few rug rats with his beautiful and devoted wife. The price? Just 400 million British Pounds.As the news of that gets around a number of shady operators want to get their cuts from a number of devious means. So the movie is mainly about that and how Mickey and those loyal to him devise methods to protect him and his investments. The cast includes a number of well-known actors and the roles are uniformly interesting.This is a good movie for those who appreciate and enjoy this type of British underworld movie, there aren't really any characters who are good people, there are just different degrees of badness.I watched it at home on BluRay from my public library, my wife skipped, not her kind of movie.",positive

"This is quite a cleverly interwoven crime story. Hugh Grant is surprisingly good in the role of a sort of camp narrator, as he tries his hand at blackmail by regaling an unflappable Charlie Hunnam with his interpretation of the goings-on around the attempted sale of an empire of ill-gotten gains by a really under-rated Matthew McConaughey, to an even more sexually ambiguous American billionaire. It's funny, mischievous and slick. Colin Farrell doesn't feature extensively, but when he does, he is cool and entertaining. There is a surfeit of Anglo-Saxon which I felt was a touch necessary - after a while it stops being a laugh and starts irritating. At times the script is witty and well paced, but for most of the film there is too little action and much too much verbiage. A good watch, though.",positive
"Michael Pearson, a marijuana kingpin, is looking to sell off his business and retire to a quiet, law-abiding life. He finds a buyer but then things start to get complicated. Another potential buyer appears and when Pearson rejects his offer, things start to go wrong in his operation.Superb. Written and directed by Guy Ritchie this has all his trademarks: gangsters as the good guys (and bad guys), clever, gritty plot with some great twists, great tongue-in cheek humour. It is a tour de force by Ritchie and, as much as I love Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch and RocknRolla, is his best work.Not only does the film play to Ritchie's strengths it also feels less formulaic than his usual gangster-crime offerings. While he is good at what he does, his plots do feel a bit repetitive at times. This, while still falling in his usual arc, has an originality about it which is quite refreshing.All this is helped by a star-studded cast - Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, Hugh Grant, Colin Farrell, Eddie Marsan - none of whom put a foot wrong. Hugh Grant is almost unrecognisable as the slimy journalist: a great departure from the shy, nerdy roles he is known for.Highly recommended.",positive
"Greetings again from the darkness. Let's get this out of the way upfront. Filmmaker Guy Ritchie's return to London crime-comedy is most assuredly a bit too far removed from today's acceptable Politically Correct line. It features mostly male characters and far too many stereotypes to count. It's also ridiculously funny. Mr. Ritchie doesn't take his story or characters too seriously, but he proves yet again that he's serious about entertainment.The film begins with Matthew McConaughey ordering ""a pint and a pickled egg"", a jolt to the senses, and a very cool opening credits sequence (think James Bond). We then find Fletcher, a sleazy private detective, making a surprise appearance at Ray's (Charlie Hunnam) house. Fletcher is played by a deliciously smarmy Hugh Grant. He is trying to extort 20 million from Ray by offering up the details he has uncovered about Ray and his boss, marijuana kingpin Mickey Pearson (McConaughey). Conveniently, Fletcher has turned the story into a screenplay, which he has generously agreed to include for the 20 million.It's tricky business trying to make drug dealers likable, and Ritchie steers clear of this despite the presence of a few. In addition to Mickey, we have Matthew Berger (Jeremy Strong) who is trying to buy Mickey's business; Lord George (Tom Wu), who controls the Chinese syndicate; and Dry Eye (Henry Goulding), an ambitious underling of Lord George who is anxious to make his own way, by any means necessary. Other players here include Mickey's wife Rosalind (Michele Dockery, ""Downton Abbey"", ""Godless"") who runs a ""safe space"" garage for exotic cars owned by women; Coach (Colin Farrell) who runs a boxing gym for troubled young adults; and Big Dave (Eddie Marsan), a tabloid editor seeking revenge for a dinner party where he felt Mickey disrespected him.As if all of those characters don't provide enough humorous crime fodder, we also have a Russian Oligarch, street gangs, heritage estate owners in need of cash, YouTube fight porn, and the plight of Laura Pressfield (Eliot Sumner, Sting's daughter) in a heroin haven. Fletcher's ongoing narrative for Ray provides the framework for the film, and each scene is filled to the rim with clever and wise-cracking dialogue - often delivered with flair by one of our colorful characters. Mr. Grant and Mr. Farrell are exceptionally fun to watch, and Ms. Dockery leaves us wishing her Rosalind was more prominently featured.For some reason he's never been a critical favorite, though Guy Ritchie garnered a cult following with his early frenetic crime flicks LOCK, STOCK and TWO SMOKING BARRELS (1998) and SNATCH (2000). Lately he's been focusing on big budget films like SHERLOCK HOLMES (2009), SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS (2011), THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. (2015) and ALADDIN (2019). He's back to his roots here, and is joined by many actors and crew members he's worked with before. Ritchie co-wrote the screenplay with Ivan Atkinson and Marne Davies. His cinematographer is Alan Stewart (ALADDIN) and his film editor in charge of those signature smash-cuts is frequent collaborator James Herbert.Quick listening pays off in some deadpan one-liners that might otherwise sneak by, although most of them can't be repeated here. The ""c-word"" most frequently used in the film is not 'cash', and is rarely a term of affection. There is even a Miramax gag. Too soon? Only you can decide. It's rare for McConaughey to play the heavy, and he seems to relish the opportunity. But then most of the actors seem to really enjoy delivering these lines and wearing these clothes ... well except for Colin Farrell's track suits and spectacles! Certainly this one isn't for the masses, and undoubtedly people will be offended. This is what happens when you make Guy Ritchie play nicely for a decade.",positive
"Guy Ritchie both wrote the story (with Ivan Atkinson and Marn Davies) and the screenplay and directed this peppery caper and the result - another unique Guy Ritchie film that continues his style of entertainment.The very brief plot summary only hints at the momentum of the film: 'Mickey Pearson, an American expat (Matthew McConaughey), tries to sell off his highly profitable marijuana empire in London, triggering plots, schemes, bribery and blackmail in an attempt to steal his domain out from under him.' Spin that idea over two hours of action in the Ritchie style and the story explodes like a July 4th evening of color and noise. The language is typically raw and predominantly profanity - and that fits the style of the story.The cast is a collection of some excellent actors: Hugh Grant 'narrates' much of the story to Ray (Charlie Hunnam), Mickey's consiglieri, and intertwines the myriad groups of eager procurers of McConaughey's marijuana estate - Jeremy Strong, Colin Farrell, Henry Golding, Tom Wu, Eddie Marsan, Jason Wong et al. Michelle Dockery is Mickey's hardnosed wife, the reason Mickey performs so well.At times the strained Cockney accents and other permutations of the English language seem forced (or simply undecipherable), but the action never stops, and the script contains some pungent ideas.

"Actually the film unspools from a frame story where Fletcher blackmails from Raymond (Hunnam), Mickey's right-hand man for the kompromat he gleans and demands a lump sum of £20 million, and Ritchie makes a jolly attempt of injecting many a homoerotic banter and teaser between them, with Raymond putting on a poker face to countervail Fletcher's salacious innuendos, and it results in one of Grant's most unstrained, jocular performances, although eventually he cannot outfox his more relaxed opponent, as Hunnam absorbs all the jests with a tongue-in-cheek admittance, certain demographic is surely being mollycoddled.reading my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks",positive

"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningMichael Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) is an American graduate of Oxford, who's built up a lucrative empire in the marijuana trade, and is planning to retire, with his partner Rosalind (Michelle Dockery.) His right hand man Ray (Charlie Hunnam) has been approached by sleazy journalist Fletcher (Hugh Grant), who thinks he's got the lowdown on a plot to overtake his empire, with Triad gangster Dry Eye (Henry Golding) at the helm, but the truth is more scattershot than he might have thought.Despite having made a name for himself in Hollywood, Guy Ritchie is still best known for his distinctive British gangster capers, of which The Gentlemen feels like an affectionate, retrospective throwback to. It's as if he didn't want to become detached from the formula that he set out with, and had to prove that he could still pull it off. The result is a serviceable, competent piece of work, though ultimately unremarkable, with a convoluted plot that does it no good.Ritchie has assembled an all star cast, ranging from American import McConaughey in the lead, and even established stars like Colin Farrell in a comic supporting role, while big British star Grant chews the scenery as a sleazy reporter, a subtle nod, no doubt, to his real life showdowns with the tabloids. It's all a big, glossy, polished affair, with the director's trademark humour still in dark abundance, just with something missing that means it doesn't hold up to his classic early work.In a day and age when crime thrillers have taken on a style all of their own, a new Guy Ritchie film truly stands alone as a particular type of affair. While The Gentlemen doesn't stand up to the quality of his early films, it's still a pleasing, darkly funny throwback to those days. ***",negative
"While I thought Jordan Peele's GET OUT was acceptable albeit overrated, US is another story altogether. It's a boringly pretentious 'survival horror' type story filled with annoying characters and rote action sequences. Things begin with an elaborate setup which lasts half an hour but feels twice as long; I felt my eyes dropping at this point. Then the action begins, and it takes the form of those predictable 'home invasion' style thrillers in which the protagonists somehow manage to keep surviving overwhelming odds. Plenty of violence and shrieking, but nothing in the way of originality, while the larger plotline is simply ridiculous. I appreciate the efforts to make an allegory and how realism isn't necessarily a priority, but this just felt like nonsense to me. Then there's the dragged-out twist ending, which anyone can guess from the beginning. Bad times.",negative
"In 1986, a girl wanders away from her father in a carnival fair. She is shocked by a doppelganger. In the present day, the Wilson family is on vacation. They are shocked by their own doppelgangers wearing red overalls and armed with scissors.I like the comedy when they happen. The horror isn't that horrific but it is intriguing. What I love most about the horror is its unknowable premise. That it is unknowable until the movie tries to let us know it. It's actually a lot more creepy when these unknown doppelgangers appear out of nowhere without explanations. The problem starts with the opening text. The knowledge of tunnels is unnecessary. It's a piece of a puzzle which is better left unsolved. The present day story should really end after the news report on the TV. It can then go back to 1986 for that surprise reveal but it's not necessary to try to explain the world beneath. I do like the final twist but it doesn't need more than that. Jordan Peele has a pretty good concept but it's not as clever as he thinks it is. That's why the harder he attempts to explain, the less interesting it is.",negative
"Middle-class Winston Duke, Lupita Nyong'o, and their two children vacation at Santa Cruz with their friends. Things turn weird and scary when dopplegangers come out of the sewers and attempt to replace them.Jordan Peele's second movie as writer and director is even more terrifying than GET OUT, in large part because of the absolute senselessness of the situation. Like Hitchcock's THE BIRDS, there is no explanation offered for the situation. Borrowing as Peele does, from classics like INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS and zombie flicks, the ""reasons"" offered have no rhyme or reason, save absolute hatred. Miss Nyong'o is terrifying as her doppleganger, Duke is purely bourgeois, and the situation malign. I'm no fan of horror movies, but this is a great one.",positive
"Let me lose a few words on ""Us"", a new American 2019 movie, and the most recent work by writer and director Jordan Peele, an Oscar winner for his screenplay on ""Get Out"". So he found an even shorter title this time and a cast list that is topped by Lupita Nyong'o, another Oscar winner and the one and only lead actor in this film. Feel free to check the supporting actor list yourself as I will spare you the names with the exception of Elisabeth Moss from Mad Men and The West Wing, always a favorite and the way she portrayaed her evil twin was great fun. But first things first: The film runs for almost 2 hours and is about a family of four who goes on a holiday the mother is not too fond of. By the way anybody else felt Lupita to be too young here, at least for being the mother of the girl?Anyway at the very beginning, Peele, just like with Get Out, used a prologue scene that lies back quite a bit in the past before the action of the actual movie we have here. Even way further than Get Out if we are specific, not just a year or so. Seems to be something Peele likes to do, while other directors/writers prefer scenes from the middle/end of the movie and then lead us to how they happened, Peele sticks with actual chronology. I like the idea. But except that, I was not too impressed by the early parts of this movie and found everything before the actual twinvasion pretty forgettable. This includes for example the scene when the boy disappears at the beach which was really ridiculous and over-the-top how she panicked. But when the family is attacked and approached inside that house, things get far more entertaining finally. The hostage situation somehow reminded me of Haneke's Funny Games, even if I was wondering why the police wasn't coming. But I guess we find out about that later on as they are just too busy, but did they take the call then? Or did the character lie about the police? I am not sure. It is not essential anyway, you can appreciate the scene without that too. I did like the red costumes by all the ""bad"" guys by the way. As for the scissor part, this sure was a trademark, but sadly it did not feel as memorable and iconic as it could have been.As for the ending and with that I am talking about the scene down there with the two Lupitas, the location was great, but the revelation was not as epic as I hoped it could be. A nice fight scene and that's it. They sure could have gotten a lot more out of that, also with where the boy is hidden. The final plot twist thumbs-up to you if you saw it coming that it was the clone all the time. I didn't, even if thinking back I could have given how much of a talented dancer she was and it's tough to create that artifically, but most of all how she is apparently the only twin that can talk, or do more than uttering lets say like we hear it from the man's twin. And the shrink session when we hear how her parents think she has changed so much. So this was a good idea that makes sense too. And she did trick the most of us I am sure. But it also fits in with the idea that the other ones are not evil, just desperate. They are just different, but they are humans as well and want the better life and are genuinely scared of the other life. Overall, Peele got in quite a few funny references again too, even if the main idea was horror obviously, not as much comedy probably as in Get Out where there is one character that almost only deals with comedy, the chubby one coming to the rescue eventually, but still here with Us you will have a moment when you smile too. Many of these moments actually. You will know what I mean when you see them.In addition, let me lose a few words on the scene when the boy's twin is killed, the one with the severe burns on his face. On the one hand I disliked the scene because it hardly could have been planned this way by the fake mother that the ""real"" boy would take these steps backwards to have the other one walk into the fire. But still, it shows us that the other mother is giving up on her ""son"" this way. Or lets say better ""the boy"" because there are no real maternal feelings involved, otherwise she wouldn't. Just like there were no feelings involved for the hunky other man, they are just thrown together like their sane counterparts are. In Germany we would say ""Zweckgemeinschaft"". And it is inevitable. They don't have free choice. They are forced to follow up and react. One thing I personally found very unimpressive was the gigantic twin chain that is referenced several times, briefly early on and much longer later on. This did absolutely nothing for me in terms of significance and metaphoric meaning and should have been left out completely for all I care. Now this film overall is sadly weaker than Get Out, but mostly because of how good Get Out was, not because this one here was bad whatsoever. It's a decent watch, especially in the middle and from the atmospheric perspective.I am curious how much awards attention Lupita will attract here. Certainly not none, but I am undecided if she can get in at the Oscars a second time. It happened frequently for previous winner that they manage a follow-up nomination not much later afterwards (Rockwell, Bridges only to mention two, but these were immediately afterwards). We will see. From the first half of the film, I think she is likely to get in, from the second not as likely except the ending perhaps. She sure won't win a second time, but I think she has a shot at making the top5 again, this time for lead and the film's unfortunate release date I would not pay too much attention to as Peele managed to get in Kaluuya too and win for screenplay with Get Out being reelased at a similar time I believe. We will see. Overall, I give Us a positive recommendation. Go watch if you like horror films.",positive
"Us is a puzzling film that slowly reveals its layers but then becomes more illogical and confusing.It is better to not think about too deeply and just enjoy the ride. It means you lose any subtext the filmmaker had about a society of us and the others.The film opens at the funfair in the boardwalk of Santa Cruz in 1986. A small girl, Adelaide is on holiday and wanders off while her father is playing whack-a-mole. As she enters a funhouse she sees a doppelgänger of herself in the hall of mirrors. This encounter left her unable to communicate for some time and still affects her in the present day.We then cut to the present day when Adelaide Wilson (Lupita Nyong'o) is vacationing at their summer home in Santa Cruz with her husband Gabe (Winston Duke) and two children Zora and Jason.One evening the Wilsons see another family that looks exactly like them standing outside the house decked out in red overalls. They look like they mean to harm them and they are somehow tethered to the soul of the individual Wilson family members.The doppelgängers all grunt except for Red, Adelaide's double who speaks with a raspy voice. Red tells Adelaide that both of them are tethered together and share a soul. These doubles live in a subterranean underground world.As an home invasion horror it is very effective and chilling, we find out that other families are being slaughtered by their doubles. It leads to a problem. Why are the Wilsons being toyed with when other families are being brutally killed and the violence is spreading as the doubles attempt to enact their own Hands across America.The moment the film broadens its premise it starts losing it logic. Even when the family try to get away from Santa Cruz and head down to Mexico, after driving all night they are somehow still in Santa Cruz. I've been to Santa Cruz it is not that big!Jordan Peele tries to underpin his film with some kind of explanation and symbolism but it is half baked. He also wants to tie the film together by making it all about Adelaide. Unlike Get Out there is little humour in this film although Gabe is meant to be a dorky dad.",positive
"The overrated ""Us"" is one of the worst films recently released that I had the chance to see. The plot is annoying and illogical, with a terrible senseless story. The performances are awful, with most of the black characters with the eyes wide open. Gabe is a stupid character taking the most imbecile attitudes. The explanation in the ending is ridiculous. In the end, ""Us"" is a waste of time: read a book, watch another movie or take a nap instead of watching this film is the best advice. My vote is two.Title (Brazil): ""Nós"" (""Us"")",negative
"A lot of hype leading up to this film, the second film from Jordan Peele, and with a lot of expectation on it. I admit I too was looking forward to it after seeing the very strong trailer for it. Mostly the film met my expectations. It was not as relentless or as frightening as the trailer had suggested it may be, but it did still have its share of tense, horrific, and intense moments. The pace and style of the delivery makes it work well, and it builds pretty nicely in terms of scale. It is very much a genre film, but that in itself is not a measure of anything, because you can have good genre films and bad ones, and this is a good one.While it is a horror, it also manages to have a good streak of dark humor running through it. The political element I think was less successful; some have been full of praise for how smart and daring it is, while others react negatively to what they perceive as a 'woke' film pushing an agenda. Personally I found interesting ideas in here but they don't hang together, unfold as the film progresses, or really give you something 100% concrete to then think back over. The ideas are not nothing though, and it is still interesting to read thoughts and theories about certain points, because they are 'interesting' but in the context of watching the film I didn't feel they were there in a meaningful way, and afterwards it did feel like I was reaching a bit to find them.The direction and performances make a big difference in this. All of the leads are good in their own ways, mostly playing it strong in their two different characters. As everyone else has said, Lupita Nyong'o is by far the strongest in not only her two characters, but the range in which she plays the main one. I wonder if the various industry awards can look beyond the genre and see the performance(s) because it is certainly more worthy of awarding than some which are given to performances of 'worthy' characters. Whether she does or doesn't though, if there are other levels in this film, it is her that finds them more than any of the various political allegories in there.So not as smart or as brilliant as the hype would have you believe, but it is still a well-crafted, interesting, and engaging horror that works mostly as a genre film, but has plenty in the style, direction, and performances to make it a quality one.",positive

"This is not flashy or shiny and it may not really cover your need for grandness. Just because this is slow burning, does not make it bad, but it may make it an experience some viewers will not like. It's about taste, what you like in a movie and what you expect from it. If you take the acting, the way this is assembled, the symbolic meanings, the soundtrack, the dialog, the structure ... it is almost flawless. And I say almost because there is always something you can detect that you may feel (or is) flawed.You may know or kind of get where this is going, but it doesn't take away the fun one can have with it. As I mentioned above this has all the right ingredients and has some ""wow"" moments too. It does not shy away from depicting or showing the violence and it has social messages. Whether you see them or not is another thing - or even care for them. Wicked idea and really good interpretation of it",positive
"Having addressed racial issues in ""Get Out"", Jordan Peele now addresses class issues in ""Us"". No accident that he used the '80s - the era of greed - as the reference point. Just like in ""Stranger Things"", ""Glow"", ""Pose"" and ""Dark"", the decade of slasher movies and the Rubik's Cube won't go away.Fine movie. I'm eager to see Peele's next movie, as well as Lupita Nyong'o's next one.",positive
"Writer and director Jordan Peele debuted and scored an Oscar winning hit with Get Out, it was a fantastic film, and when I heard and saw the trailer for his next movie, I was really hoping it would be as good. Basically in 1986, young Adelaide Thomas (Madison Curry) is on vacation with her parents in Santa Cruz. On the beach, she wanders off and enters a funhouse, where she encounters a doppelgänger of herself in the hall of mirrors. Adelaide is later reunited with her parents, but she is unable to speak. In the present day, Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o) is an adult, and heading to the family beach house in Santa Cruz with her own family, husband Gabe Wilson (Winston Duke) and their children, Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex). Adelaide remember the traumatic incident from her childhood, so she is apprehensive about the trip. But Gabe brushes off her concerns, he is eager to impress their friends Josh (Tim Heidecker) and Kitty Tyler (Elisabeth Moss) and buys a boat. At the beach, Jason wanders off and sees a man wearing a red jumpsuit standing alone in the sand with his arms stretched out and blood on his hands. Later that night, a strange family of four appears in the driveway of the beach house. They stand still and do not respond when Gabe communicates and then tries to intimidate them. Eventually they move towards him, attack and break into the home. The Wilsons realise the four intruders are doppelgängers of themselves, led by Adelaide's double, Red (Nyong'o). Each of them is wearing a red jumpsuit like the man on the beach, and Jason's doppelgänger Pluto (Alex) is wearing a white mask, to cover his deformed face. Red, the only doppelgänger who speaks, tells the Wilsons the story of a girl who lives a happy life while her shadow suffers. The family is then separated by their opposites: Red makes Adelaide handcuff herself to the table, Zora is taken by Umbrae (Wright Joseph), Gabe is dragged onto the boat by Abraham (Duke), and Jason is sent to ""play"" with Pluto in a closet. Umbrae is interrupted by an investigating neighbour while chasing Zora, she stabs him with a pair of golden scissors, while Zora escapes. Gabe is able to throw Abraham overboard and kill him with the boat's malfunctioning motor, while Jason finds Pluto mirrors his actions almost exactly. Jason is able to distract Pluto with a magic trick and escapes, locking Pluto in the closet. Red goes to the closet hearing Pluto's cries, giving Adelaide time to break free. The family regroups and escapes on Gabe's boat. Meanwhile, the Tylers are also murdered by a set of doubles shortly before the Wilsons arrive. The Wilsons kill the Tylers' doubles and turn on the news to see that millions of doppelgängers, calling themselves ""the Tethered"", have been murdering their real counterparts throughout the United States. The doppelgängers subsequently join hands together to form a massive human chain, which the newscasters speculate is a form of protest. The Wilsons drive away in the Tylers' car until they are attacked by Umbrae, who is killed after being launched into a tree from the top of the vehicle. As day breaks, the Wilsons arrive at the Santa Cruz boardwalk, where they find their own abandoned car on fire. Pluto has set a trap to kill the Wilsons by lighting a trail of petrol to the car, but Jason, remembering that Pluto mirrors his every move, walks backward so that Pluto steps into the fire and is killed. Red then reappears and abducts Jason. While Zora and Gabe recuperate in an abandoned ambulance, Adelaide returns to the boardwalk funhouse from her past. She walks through a secret tunnel in the hall of mirrors, which leads to a facility underground, overrun by rabbits. There she finds Red, who states that the Tethered were created by the U.S. government in an attempt to control the public, but the experiment failed and the Tethered were abandoned underground. For generations, the Tethered were trapped beneath the surface, doing nothing but mimicking the actions of their above-ground counterparts until Red organised them to escape. The two fight, Adelaide manages to kill Red, she rescues Jason, and promises him that things will return to normal. When the family leave town, Adelaide thinks back to the night she first met Red in the funhouse, it is revealed that she is actually one of the Tethered and had taken Adelaide's place in the surface world. As the family drives away, helicopters hovering above see the Tethered joining hands together across the United States. Also starring Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Russel Thomas / Weyland, Anna Diop as Rayne Thomas / Eartha, Cali Sheldon as Becca Tyler / Io, Noelle Sheldon as Lindsey Tyler / Nix, Ashley Mckoy as Teenage Adelaide Wilson / Teenage Red and Napiera Groves as Dr. Foster. Nyong'o, Duke, Moss and the younger cast members all do their parts fine, it is written and directed reasonably well by Peele, it is a very creepy concept, people on holiday terrorised by evil lookalikes who want to get revenge and kill their counterparts, there are enough thrills to keep up the pace, the social commentary themes are clever (the title spelled ""US"", the quote ""we're Americans""), and it makes you laugh a little, I admit I personally did not find it as inventive as Get Out, but it is a worthwhile horror. Good!",positive
"When Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o) returns to Santa Cruz, the site of a childhood trauma, with her husband Gabe (Winston Duke) and children Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex), she finds her family stalked by a group of doppelgängers intent on doing them harm.My initial thought: that's no way to play whack-a-mole. You don't just stand there and hit the same mole over and over. Couldn't the actor be bothered? Still, I'm a reasonable person and can let that slide just so long as the rest of the film is good.Unfortunately, it turns out that iffy whack-a-mole tactics are the least of this film's problems.Character development is fine-I liked the central family, and their obnoxious friends were fun, but once the shadow people appear, it all starts to go a bit pear-shaped...I understand that the home invasion scene is intended to be dark comedy, which I'm fine with, but I'd liked to have had some genuine tension and a few solid frights along the way. At no point did I feel scared, which is disappointing when you've signed on for a horror movie. I also don't understand why the doppelgängers don't kill the family straight away (other than for the convenience of the plot), but that's just one puzzler amongst many.Peele finally hits his horror stride with the attack at the neighbours' home, and the fight against the shadow twins, but once it becomes apparent that the phenomena is nationwide, the film takes a serious nosedive. Rather than leave the nature of his villains mysterious, Peele gives us a ridiculous back story to the shadow people that makes very little sense whatsoever.The viewer is expected to believe in the creation of thousands, nay millions, of underground shadow people who control the population above through puppetry. These people live in a network of tunnels and, so I understand, eat raw rabbit meat. This premise leaves countless unanswered questions, none of which are adequately addressed. It's a half-assed attempt at an explanation which would have been best left unsaid.Peele then expects us to swallow the idea that the countless shadow people have been organised into an army by Adelaide's evil doppelgänger. Clad in red jumpsuits and armed with scissors (acquired from a subterranean red jumpsuit and golden scissors warehouse, no doubt), she plans for her people to invade the world above. To what end? To overpower their more privileged doubles and then hold hands in a chain across America, as an act of defiance and solidarity.All of this is intended as a metaphor for class divide in America, mirroring the fight between the haves and have-nots, and the struggle for equality, but the subtext comes at the expense of logic and narrative cohesion. Peele closes matters with a silly twist ending that only raises further awkward questions.My closing thought: could have been great, but the whack-a-mole incident is just the start of it.",negative
"I watched this at home on BluRay from my public library. Not my wife's type of movie.This movie had generated a reasonable amount of hype, plus it has Lupita Nyong'o in it, so I was anxious to see it. I found it very well made with many interesting visuals, but with one difficulty.When a writer/director makes a movie with lots of symbolism he or she sees very clearly what they want to convey. However each viewer comes away with different degrees of comprehension of what his/her intent was. I read a number of ""professional"" reviews and most of them have praise for ""Us"" but each with different takeaways.I'm not sure what points the movie was trying to make, something about our shadows always getting the short end of the stick. Something about thousands of miles of tunnels in the USA. Then the twist at the end, when we find out what really happened to the young girl in the hall of mirrors in 1986.So, while I mostly found it an entertaining viewing I don't come away with some new revelation about people and their lives. I mostly enjoyed seeing scenes of Santa Cruz where we vacationed just a few years ago, walking the same streets where the car fire scene was shot near the end of the movie, plus the beach and the pier.I think many viewers, who are not professional movie critics, will not enjoy seeing this movie because the themes and messages are mostly obscure.Edit: First I want to say no movie should require ""extras"" on a disc to explain the movie. But I DID watch some of the extras on the BD afterward and in particular the filmmaker talking about what motivated him to come up with this particular story, and that is interesting. Part of it is we think as if we somehow earned being in an affluent position, as the featured family was, when in fact it was just luck of being born where we were. And the idea that meeting your doppelganger can be scary. But he also admits that it is just a popcorn flick, not to be taken too seriously.",positive
"I wanted to like this movie. I really, really did. But I just couldn't get into it.Whereas ""Get Out"" was mildly interesting at least, ""Us"" is just downright laughable.The movie starts out well enough with writer and director Jordan Peele actually managing to set a good atmosphere and slowly build up suspense. But the entire setup came crashing hard when you find out what is going on and the mysterious looming strangers are revealed.Now, the acting performances in the movie were good, but it was so hard to take the Red character serious with the way she was talking. It just fully destroyed everything that was even remotely interesting about the character.I enjoyed the movie up to the point where you find out about the strangers in red, then I just went blank and watched the movie with half of my attention on the screen and the other half on social media on my phone. Yeah, the movie ended up being that unappealing.I managed to endure this ordeal to the bitter end, and I can't claim to have been entertained in a memorable and satisfying manner from this movie.

"This film tells the story of a family who becomes hunted by an identical looking family.The film has much suspense and thrill. The action keeps on coming, and you really want to find out what is next. It all is intense and engaging, until the final scene shatters everything.

"Jordan Peele's attempted suspenseful thriller comes across a bit flat. A family goes of to a beach home for some relaxation and fun. This family holiday is interrupted by uninvited guest. At closer look these interlopers are suspicious and harmful acting doppelgangers. Any urgent momentum quickly dies, even though lives are at stake. Hardly any time for character building, in spite of almost 2 hour run time. Twists and turns in the plot were not helpful. Poorly timed humor makes the story line a bit confusing and the finale hardly deserves applause. I'm sure high hopes were expected.Starring are: Lupita Nyong'o, Winton Duke, Anna Diop, Elisabeth Moss, Madison Curry and Shahadi Wright-Joseph.",negative

"Writer/Director Jordan Peele's Follow-Up to the Immensely Popular and Critically Acclaimed ""Get Out"" (2018) is a Tense and Bloody Psychological Social Study.All Elements, Acting, Cinematography, Score, and, of course, Writing and Directing are Superb and Accomplished Far Beyond what's Expected from a Beginning Filmmaker.The Multi-Layered Story, that Runs almost 2 Hours, is Never Dull or Lacking in Scares, Suspense, and Build-Up to the Final Reveal.Much of the Slaughter and Gore takes place Off-Screen, but the Bloody-Aftermath is Forever Present.It's a much more Personally Terrifying Story than Most Horror Movies.It is Massaged with some Well-Placed and Off-Beat, yet Appropriate Humor.The Strange Musical Score with Emphasis on Sounds and Drawn-Out Musical Strains is Eerie and Enhances the Mood Considerably.The Underlying Thesis is mostly Revealed but some Ambiguity Remains for Consideration.Overall, Another Winner for Peele, the Cast and the Entire Production Crew.It's Really a Treat for Fans used to Less than Stellar Entries in the Overload of Cheap and Not Very Well Done Movies in the Genre.",positive

"A family on vacation is confronted outside their home by a family who look identical to them.Written and directed by Jordan Peele, of Key and Peele fame, Us follows in the same vein as Peele's previous movie, his debut offering 'Get Out': a reasonably clever and engaging horror movie. He's now carving out a for himself in horror, which is a far cry from his comedy roots.Us doesn't have the same coherent social messaging that Get Out had, but makes up for this with a compelling-viewing horror-thriller plot. It takes a while to get going, but once it does it is an action-packed roller-coaster ride.Does falter towards the end though. Some plot developments are nonsensical and inconsistent with what came before and the ultimate revelation is pretty tame. Conclusion is also quite weak. A pity, as the first 70-80% was great.Overall, worth a watch, just set your expectations for the ending quite low.",positive
"Adelaide(Lupita Nyong'o, on edge, striving for normalcy) and the rest of her middle class family go to their beach house in Santa Cruz for the Summer. After several weird occurrences, they come face-to-face with some dangerous looking people. The thing is, their attackers look exactly like... well, as one of her two kids notes: ""it's us"".Some viewers grow frustrated trying to find a real-world explanation for the events of this. In my opinion, you simply have to read it as an allegory. And if you do so, you may, like I, find that it has a cornucopia of food for thought. In most ways, this is almost as good as Get Out, Jordan Peele's directorial debut. We again have actors delivering incredible performances as creepy, off putting ""not quite okay"" types. A lot of the cast here actually have to play both regular versions, and their sinister, cruel counterparts, and they are all incredible. In some ways this is like a zombie movie, and in others, a slasher. It's delightfully subversive, playing with cliches and tropes. You never know exactly what is going to happen. The soundtrack is excellent.There is a lot of strong language, as well as bloody, gory violence in this. I recommend this to horror fans. 7/10.",positive
"US (2019) *** Lupita Nyong'o, Winston Duke, Elisabeth Moss, Tim Heidecker, Shahadi Wright Joseph, Evan Alex. Jordan Peele attempts the sophomore jinx with this decidedly Shyamalan turn (not a good thing) in this horror film about a nuclear family facing a sudden attack by their deadly dopplegangers during a much needed vacation retreat. Claustrophobic and atmospheric (largely thanks to the pin-pricking score by Michael Abels) the film rests its huge agenda (people need people even if they are supernaturally so) on the slender yet capable shoulders of Nyong'o who successfully scores the hat trick in playing both good and evil versions with aplomb and empathy. Otherwise by mid-way you can figure the course of action and the attempt of a twist ending is sadly lacking in subtlety.",negative
"When Adelaide is a child, she meets a duplicate of herself in a hall of mirrors at the Santa Cruz beach fairground. The trauma of this manifests itself when her husband forces the family to holiday at Santa Cruz beach years later against her will. So, when a family of duplicates appears on their first night, she - and we - are not too surprised. Horrified, maybe, but surprised - naah.Certain filmmakers believe their own publicity and early critical success leads them fatally down the path of self-indulgence. Yes, Tarantino, I'm looking at you. Don't snigger, Shyamalan, you're not off the hook. And as for you, Aranovsky... Snyder, come back here! All of you, you need someone to edit you, reign you in, curb your excesses, think things through when you don't do so.I do hope Jordan Peele doesn't join them although, on the basis of this second movie, he is in danger of doing so. Much of this film is very good, particularly the performances from Lupita Nyong'o. And then we get to the explanation and the shock/twist ending/s. Well, we certainly needed an explanation (I'm still waiting for an explanation of Michael Myers), but this explanation makes No. Sense. At. All. And then the twist means that it makes no sense at all, twice.This bit needed thinking through much, much more. I'm not going to list all the many, many things where the explanation simply raised more questions, I'll just say that an otherwise enjoyable paranoia horror with some splatter and some black humour left me frowning afterwards.There is a very good film trying, and failing, to escape from a film which isn't quite there.And the husband? What an annoying idiot. She'd have been better off with the one in the red jumpsuit.",negative
"Jordan Peele's follow up to ""Get Out"" recreates both much of what worked about that earlier film and the missteps that ultimately made it less than satisfying.""Us"" ratchets up the tension nicely as it introduces us to a loving family on vacation in a cabin in the woods. It then explodes into an invigorating blend of visceral horror and very funny comedy as that family is attacked by a group of doppelgangers bent on doing them harm for unknown reasons. But as the film draws to its obtuse conclusion, Peele feels the need to over explain, and the creepy mystery at the film's center instead turns into awkward and literal plot exposition. How much more satisfying everything might have been if left unexplained.Still, most of this film is wildly entertaining, and Peele is one director who makes films that feel completely plugged into our troubled times. He really does have a unique style, and both ""Get Out"" and ""Us"" bear the stamp of a formidable originality. It's just his storytelling that needs some work.The acting in this movie is fantastic, especially by Lupita Nyong'o, who's fierce in a double role as the mom and the mom's frightening twin. It's not an exaggeration to say that her performance is award worthy.Grade: A-",positive
"Ready of Not is a very, very violent, bloody and crude film. I am not necessarily criticizing it for this, but you must know this before you decide to watch. It clearly is an adult film...but even one most adults might have trouble watching because of all the gore. Be forewarned...you will see extreme violence, exploding people and more!!! Think twice before you watch!!This should be the best day of Grace's life. After all, she's just married a handsome guy from an incredibly wealthy family. But apparently, this marriage comes with a possible downside....the family are all Satan worshipers who owe their immense wealth to their demon master. And, as part of maintaining their wealth, they have a ritual for when new blood marries into the family...and if you pick the wrong card, the family hunts you and sacrifices you! What follows is this crazy family and their servants chasing Grace about in order to kill her and impress their lord and master!Despite the summary and TONS of blood and gore, the film is also a comedy. It's not a fall on the floor laughing sort of film but a darkly sick and twisted sort of comedy. The ending combines both...intense gore and the biggest laughs of the movie. Not everyone's taste...but funny and sick. And, it's also not for those who get motion sick, as the shaky cam is, unfortunately, overused in the movie.",negative
"READY OR NOT is an interesting film but also a deeply flawed one that's never quite as funny or as entertaining as it tries to be. I liked the whole idea of the sinister rich family in their wonderful 'old dark house' inspired mansion and the idea of the heroine being hunted down, a little like the French flick FRONTIERS. Unfortunately what promises to be a TURKEY SHOOT-style cat and mouse story of human hunting turns into a largely aimless comedy with repetitive set-pieces and a sub-par script substituting bad language for wit. It's a pity, as the direction is solid and the performances are strong, but imagine this cast with proper dialogue to play with! I also found the climax a cop out as I was expecting this kind of over-obvious thing to happen. Not a bad film, just something I was expecting more from.",positive
Grace (Samara Weaving) and Alex (Mark O'Brien) are getting married at his rich family's massive estate. She's informed that she must play a game before being admitted into the family. It's a matter of life and death.I didn't expect much from this B-horror with no big fanfare. One or two of these fun little horrors out-jumps its peers every year and this is one of them. It has a lot of fun. Samara is a solid lead. It has a fun takedown of wealth and family corruption. The movie takes a fun thrill-filled idea and executes it. It's comparable to Happy Death Day.,positive
"Grace (Samara Weaving), who was raised in foster houses, meets Alex Le Domas (Mark O'Brien), who belongs to a wealthy traditional family, and they soon fall in love with each other. They decide to get married to each other at the Le Domas mansion and during the wedding night Alex tells to Grace that shall play a game to join the family. Grace meets the whole family in an isolated room and draws a card from the deck. When she shows the ""Hide and Seek"" card, the family members ask her to hide while they hunt her down in the mansion in a weird ritual to Satan.""Ready or not"" is a black humor comedy with lots of gore highly funny for fans of the genre. The characters are great: Alex´s brother Daniel is alcoholic; his wife Charity is a hunter of dowry; Alex´s father Tony is a wealthy man who cares to the tradition; his wife Becky seems to be reasonably sane but the family comes first; Alex´s sister Emilie is a crazy addicted woman; her husband Fitch is a lazy man; Alex´s Aunt Helene is evil. When the hunting starts, the situations are funny and non-sense as dawn approaches and the family fears to be terminated by Satan. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Ready or Not - O Ritual"" (""Ready or Not - The Ritual"")",negative
"The film is a dark comedy and a generic spoof of family ritualistic satanic films. It opens with a wedding to Beethoven's 9th symphony D minor etc played during ""Clockwork Orange"" while Alex DeLong was being tortured by his own love for the music. Grace, a commoner (Samara Weaving) is going to wed Alex Le Domas whose family has ""more money than God."" They made their money from the manufacturing of games. At Midnight, they must play a game drawn from a card taken from an old box that they play or die. Grace was hoping for checkers.The title hints at the game and film poster of an armed bride who is dirty, tattered, and torn tells you what happens. The film had a number of light moments with an ending that made me laugh. Melanie Scrofano plays Emilie who loves her cocaine and can't shoot straight. Some of the players are apathetic about the game but play because they are told they must or die. The family consisted of a cast of characters that made the film fun.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",positive
"Or is it? Right from the start we do realize there is more to it than just a simple game. So with that overshadowing the next section of the movie (viewer being ahead of our main character/heroine), it is up to the actors and the dialog/script to keep us on our toes and make this entertaining nonetheless.And the movie succeeds in doing so. I guess it could have been even better in some respects, but overall this is really good. The characters make sense (in their own universe) and the story is coherent enough (even if you may disagree with that statement during the end - I think the joke works quite well ... but that's me). Not for the faint hearted for sure ...",positive
"Two years ago, ""Get Out"" addressed racism through the prism of a not-what-it-seems relationship. Now, ""Ready or Not"" looks at class structure through the same format. Much like how ""Crazy Rich Asians"" showed how rich people expect their children only to marry within their ""respectable"" range, this one shows how anyone from outside the country club crows is immediately ""the other"" to these people. And if the bride is the other, you can do whatever you want to her. Mind you, there are some shocking scenes. But it's all well done. Definitely see it.",positive
"I saw the trailer at least four times before the film's release, it looked like a good concept for a scary movie, and I'm glad it received positive reviews, including from Mark Kermode, so I was really looking forward to it. Basically, the wealthy Le Domas family hosts a generations-long tradition of playing a game at midnight on the wedding night with each new addition to the family. In a flashback many years ago, young Alex Le Domas (Chase Churchill) and his brother Daniel (Etienne Kellici) witness the killing of a man named Charles (Andrew Anthony), who has just married their aunt Helene (Elana Dunkelman). Thirty years later, Grace (Samara Weaving, Hugo's niece) is the newest addition to the Le Domas family, having married Alex (Mark O'Brien), who has been estranged from the family for years. Alex is hesitant to be back at the family estate, but Grace reassures him and is eager to become part of his family. Following the wedding ceremony, Grace is informed of the family initiation custom and meets with the rest of the in-laws. Participating in the tradition with the happy couple are Alex's alcoholic brother Daniel (Adam Brody), father Tony (Henry Czerny), mother Becky (Andie MacDowell), Daniel's snobbish wife Charity (Elyse Levesque), Alex's drug-addicted sister Emilie (Melanie Scrofano), Emilie's whiny husband Fitch Bradley (Kristian Bruun), and Tony's older sister, the sombre Helene (Nicky Guadagni). Tony is told that she must draw a card from a mysterious wooden box and play whatever game is written on the card with the family and become a member of the ""dominion"". Tony tells the story of his great-grandfather Victor Le Domas, who made a deal with a man named Mr. Le Bail, who helped to create the Le Domas fortune if the family established the tradition. Grace draws from the box a card that reads ""Hide and Seek."" Grace believes the game is harmless, she will be hiding while the other family members seek. While she leaves to hide in the estate, the Le Domas family, excluding Alex, arm themselves with antique weapons to hunt her down. Alex manages to find Grace before his family, they witness Emilie accidentally kill a maid, shooting her in the head with a shotgun. Alex didn't tell Grace about the Le Domas tradition, believing says the odds of Hide and Seek being chosen being unlikely, it is the only game that would prompt the family to try to kill Grace. The Le Domas family believes that if they fail to kill Grace before dawn, they will all die as part of the deal with Mr. Le Bail (whose name is an anagram of Belial, an alias for Satan), decades earlier. Grace is shocked and angry with Alex at not telling her about the ritual, but he feared she would leave him. Against his family's wishes, Alex promises Grace he will help her escape, he heads to the house's security room and tells Grace to go to the kitchen. While looking for the exit, Grace encounters a second maid, she accidentally activates the mechanical dumbwaiter elevator and kills the maid. Daniel, who is also against the family tradition, finds Grace in the study. She pleads with him for help, but he says he has no choice, but offers her a ten-second head start before he alerts the others. Alex deactivates the security cameras and unlocks the doors of the house. However, he is captured and restrained by the family when they discover his betrayal. Grace tears her wedding gown to free her legs for mobility and arms herself. She manages to escape the kitchen after eluding the family butler Stevens (John Ralston), scalding him with boiling water. The family members regroup and lament the difficulty in killing Grace but reiterate they must do so before sunrise. During this discussion, Emilie accidentally kills a third maid with a crossbow through the head. Stevens informs the family Grace has escaped outside but promises to capture her. Grace hides in the barn, there she is shot in the hand by Emilie's son Georgie (Liam MacDonald), falling into the ""goat pit"" where the family have hidden the remains of previous victims. Grace manages to climb out and escapes through a fence, injuring herself further, and fails to stop a passing motorist for help. On the road, Stevens chases after Grace in a car, but she manages to temporarily disable him and takes the car after gets out. She tries to call for help using the vehicle assistance company, but the car was reported stolen and the car is disable remotely, allowing Stevens to tranquilize and capture Grace. Stevens drives her back to the estate, but Grace wakes up and causes him to crash the car, killing him. Grace runs, but Daniel discovers her, knowing that Tony is secretly watching, he knocks her out again and recaptures her. The Le Domas family prepares to sacrifice Grace in a Satanic ritual. They each drink from a cup as part of the ritual, but vomit, besides Daniel who has poisoned them all, saying they deserve to die. While Alex escapes his captivity, Daniel frees Grace and they attempt to leave the house. But Daniel is shot and killed by Charity. Grace starts a fire, but the family members ignore it and continue to pursue her. She gets into a fight with Becky and manages to beat her to death with the box. Alex arrives and realises that, even if he lets Grace live, she won't want to be with him, he captures her and alerts the family. The family try again to sacrifice Grace, holding her down. Alex tries to stab her in the heart but misses and stabs her in shoulder. They then see that the sun has come up, meaning it is now too late. As they recoil in horror for their impending death, nothing happens. Helene plans to kill Grace anyway, but as she grabs the axe, she suddenly explodes into a bloody mess. One by one, the other family members look in horror and try to flee as each blow up. Tony pleads for a reprieve to Mr. Le Bail, but to no avail and dies. Last to go, Alex begs Grace for forgiveness, but explodes when Grace demands a divorce. As the house is engulfed in flames, Grace momentarily sees the figure of Mr. Le Bail sitting at the head of the table. He nods in approval and allows her to leave, covered in the blood of the exploded Le Domas family members. Outside the house, Grace sits on the steps as the fire blazes behind her and smokes a cigarette as emergency services arrive. When someone asks her what happened, Grace shrugs and replies: ""In-laws"". Also starring Kate Ziegler as Young Becky. Weaver gives a fantastic as the unsuspecting bride who inadvertently becomes the victim of a deadly game, the other cast members, including an against-type MacDowell, play the aristocratic family with a dark agenda very well. The twisted game of Hide and Seek is the main draw, and the deal with the devil element is clever, there are some thrilling moments, but it not just tense, it is also witty and very funny, with the madness and slaughter being the butt of the joke, a great fun black comedy horror. Very good!",positive
"After Grace (Samara Weaving) marries into a wealthy family who have made their fortune creating board games, she finds that she must participate in a game of hide and seek before she will be properly accepted as one of the clan. But as Grace hides in the sprawling family mansion, her new in-laws tool up with a variety of weapons and set out to find and kill the young woman as part of a Satanic ritual.After watching Mayhem and The Babysitter, I found that I had developed a strong aversion to Samara Weaving's scream, a horrible warbling sound that sets my teeth in edge, but I was willing to try and put my animosity to one side for Ready or Not, the trailer for which looked like a lot of fun. I failed: her scream still got on my nerves, but as it happens, Weaving's warbling was just one of many reasons why I didn't enjoy this film.All of the characters are unlikable (Grace included) and unbelievable (husband Alex does a 180-degree personality flip), the plot goes nowhere for most of the film, the intended dark comedy falls horribly flat, the ending is predictable (reminding me a little of Drag Me To Hell), the location is underused (the servants tunnels, in particular, are totally wasted), and for a film given an 18 certificate for 'bloody violence and strong scenes of gore', there's very little in the way of inventive or graphic kills. Also, try as hard as you can, but you'll never convince me that it is possible to saw through a solid piece of hardwood with the chain on a pair of handcuffs.Save your money, save your time and save the strain on your ear drums (that scream!!!).3.5/10, generously rounded up to 4 for the creepy Hide and Seek song.",negative
"Marriage - especially the ceremony itself - can be terrifying. The best horror movies take a frightening moment in our lives and show how ""what's the worst that can happen"" explodes outward into a spiraling miasma of sheer madness. In a year sadly bereft of many great - or even halfway decent - horror films, Ready Or Not has arrived to squarely punch you right in the face and spit blood in your eye.For generations, the wealthy Le Domas family has remained in power by conducting a ritual on the night that anyone new enters the family. Tonight, prodigal son Alex has returned home to marry Grace (the niece of Hugo Weaving, who also appeared in The Babysitter and Mayhem), an orphan who has been raised in foster homes.Years ago, the great-great-grandfather of the Le Domas family made a deal with Mr. Le Bail and the family must play one game - they're pretty much Hasbro in real life - at the end of the wedding ceremony. It could be something as simple as Old Maid. Yet it ends up being the worst card - Hide And Seek.Now, the entire Le Domas family is hunting down Grace, who only thinks that she's playing a game. Maid after maid gets caught in the crossfire and the entire extended family - children included - are armed, dangerous and after our heroine.Henry Czerny shines as Tony Le Domas, the crazed leader of the clan, and Andie McDowell is wonderful as his somewhat conflicted wife Becky. One of the relationships at the center of this film is between good brother Alex and bad sibling Daniel ((Adam Brody, Seth from The O.C.). Of course, this being horror, what is good and what is evil will change throughout this long night of the soul.There are parts of this film that aspire to be more than mere slasher or modern horror. That's a good thing. It may be me reading into things, but the scene where Grace escapes into the fields was reminiscent of the framing and pace of Suzy Kendall being chased in Sergio Martino's Torso. And without giving too much away, the close finally delivers on the levels of gore and supernatural menace that has been slowly hinted during the film's run time. Joyously, this feels like a movie with no dead spots, growing tighter and taunter as the slowly more blood-caked and torn wedding gown that Grace wears throughout.I have to single out Nicky Guadagni, who was in Cube, for her portrayal of Helena. The loss of her husband at the film's start has warped her into the twisted center of this family, despite what the male head would have you think. She's turned her loss into less than sacrifice and more of a reason for being. Drug addict sister Emilie (Melanie Scrofano, the lead on SyFy's Wynonna Earp) is pretty great, too.So often, modern horror hasn't been certain how to combine humor and terror. Ready Or Not gets it right. Then again, I have a weird sense of humor, so I laughed joyously at moments that no one else found funny. Too bad - I would have preferred to see this in a much rougher theater than the comfortable place where it unspooled so that people would have been unafraid to scream and yell at the screen. After all, that's what movies are for.Ready Or Not was directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin (V/H/S) and Tyler Gillett (Devil's Due), who are part of the Radio Silence film collective. It was written by Guy Busick (Stan Against Evil) and Ryan Murphy (Minute's Until Midnight).I will spoil one part of the film. At the close, as Grace draws a drag of cigarette despite being covered in grime, gore, viscera and her own blood, there's an echo of a movie from the past, Heathers. That made me clap in the theater - despite the machinations of family, the man she loves and even fate, Grace is not going away without a fight. Her spirit is one that even the devil must sit up and take notice of - quite literally.",positive
"They're going to find her. And make her suffer...Sorry, but when you see that title, how can you not automatically complete the lyrics of the 1996 smash-hit by The Fugees? Anyway, ""Ready or Not"" is a very entertaining and surprisingly competent action/horror ride with a strong feminine protagonist, a healthy dose of humor and a handful of inventively gory gimmicks. I state ""surprisingly"" competent, because thus far I only knew the directors Tyler Gillett and Matt Bettinelli-Oplin from the anthologies ""Southbound"" and ""V/H/S"" and, well, I though they both sucked. This film blends two very familiar horror themes, namely hunting for humans and severely dysfunctional murder-families, but present them in a very fun and enjoyable format. Grace and Daniel celebrate their wedding's day at Daniel's parental estate. It's the first time the bride meets her in-laws, and basically only knows they are a bunch of eccentric rich people whose empire is built on generations of successful boardgames development. At midnight, and according to an ancient tradition, Grace must participate in a game of hide and seek before she's fully accepted into the family. Her wedding night will be wild and nasty, but probably not how she imagined it. If you look past some flaws and improbabilities (like some of the characters implausible behavioral changes) you'll find this an enjoyable movie. The grotesque and bloody finale is hilarious, the hide-and-seek nursery tune is creepy, and the performances are good. It's particularly fun to see Andie MacDowell is a highly unusual role for a change. I swear you'll never look at ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" in the same way again.",positive
"This is quite an intense slasher adventure. I get write nervous at times, with sweaty palms because of the bride's close encounters with death. The ending makes me laugh though!",positive
"I've just read approximately a dozen negative reviews right here on imdb and I'm guessing that these were penned by the Nightmare On Elm St/Halloween set i.e. the kind of moviegoer who takes gore seriously and thus feels let down by this tongue-in-cheek entry. I, on the other hand, have yet to see a Saw (sorry about that, Texas Chainsaw Massacre or indeed anything remorely resembling 'horror' so I was happy to go along with this black comedy and bask in the laugh out loud moments that punctuated it. I doubt if it would claim to be another Some Like It Hot, or even Young Frankenstein but it's harmless and reasonably entertaining.",positive
"I will give it to ready or not, it does not let up! The whole movie is just utter insanity from the beginning to the last second. You think you're ready, but you're not, it's wild. Weaving does a great job as the main character, she's put through her paces and just keeps moving (and looks pretty badass doing it!). I really enjoyed the quirky nature of the dialogue and acting. You're laughing one minute, then gasping the next. They make no bones about the premise and each character plays their part beautifully. The ending is a bit weird, but in context it couldn't have ended any better. Really something.",positive

"When Grace marries into the Le Domas family, whose great wealth is from the sales of games, it's not a huge surprise to find out that a family game features on her wedding night. The game is Hide and Seek, and it turns out that the object is not so much to avoid being found, it's more to avoid being found and killed.This simple idea is played for all it's worth between a varied crop of family members and the necessarily resourceful Grace. The cast is low profile but very good, the film is nicely staged, there is a decent story and script, and the combination of bloodshed and laughs works well. This is not laugh-out-loud, but the steady stream of black comedy is constantly amusing.I really liked this.",positive
"Greetings again from the darkness. Rich people aren't like you and me (unless you happen to be rich, in which case you fall into the first category). Their houses are different. Their vacations are different. Their family traditions are different. And that's where this latest from co-directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillet (known collectively with Producer Matt Villella as Radio Silence) really kicks in. Yes, the Le Domas estate is a maze of dark wood, music rooms, and hidden passages, but it's the wedding day tradition of post nuptial game night that provides the thrills, chills, shocks and laughter for about an hour and a half.Former foster child Grace (a star-making performance from Samara Weaving, THE BABYSITTER, THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING MO), is nervous and excited just before her wedding ceremony begins. Her husband to be is Alex Le Domas (Mark O'Brien), the black sheep of an ultra-rich family, and the ceremony is being held within the lush garden and fountain grounds of the Le Domas mansion. Grace loves Alex and seems to have come to grips with his family: alcoholic brother Daniel (Adam Brody) who is always hitting on her, Daniel's gold-digger wife Charity (Elyse Levesque), father and patriarch Tony (Henry Czerny) who is outspoken in his belief that Grace isn't good enough for the family, mother and matriarch Becky (Andie MacDowell) who seems confused about her feelings towards Grace, crazy-eyed Aunt Helene (Nicky Guardagni) who seems to hate all living creatures, and coke-head sister Emilie (Melanie Scrofano) who, along with her husband Fitch (Kristian Bruun) couldn't even get to the ceremony on time.The above lineup of players is crucial because of what happens next. For wedding day game night, Grace draws the ""Hide and Seek"" card, rather than the much preferred checkers or Old Maid. There is a nice set up for this tradition which includes a Faustian deal made by Great Grandfather Le Domas. It's that deal that turns 'hide and seek' into 'hunt and kill'. Oh yeah, Alex forgot to warn Grace about the stakes and it's a blast to watch her transition as she figures it out. A torn wedding gown and yellow Chucks make up the visual of a bride fighting back against the antique weapons of crossbow, pocket pistol, elephant gun and battle-axe. You got it right - this family tradition is absolutely bonkers ... and bloody ... and deadly.As has become the favorite pastime of Hollywood recently, the film torches the ultra-rich. But if you can overlook the political posturings, you'll find a devilishly fun irreverent farcical zinger that offers some similarities to CLUE and SLEUTH, as well as many other games and movies. It has some of the look of SAW, but with significantly more tongue-in-cheek. In fact, dark comedy thriller might be a proper description, but you'll likely find yourself laughing more often than jumping in your seat. It's a wonderfully crafted and paced film that understands exactly what it is ... an instant classic Midnight Movie (along with this year's SATANIC PANIC from director Chelsea Stardust).Co-writers Guy Busick and Ryan Murphy take full advantage of the ominous setting and the wicked set-up, however, a minor quibble would be that the dialogue could have been a bit wittier. Most of the laughs come courtesy of the moment or the actors, and the banter falls just a little short. The prologue provides a 30 year ago flashback that cautions us for the ride we are about to take, and even offers some insight into the characters as much younger versions of themselves. The opening credit sequence is a beautifully staged and filmed running shot of some classic board games, informing us of the industry closely associated with the Le Domas 'dominion'.It must be noted that a studio recently postponed the theatrical release of THE HUNT because of the political backlash to their premise - rich people hunting poor people. While the themes of these two films could be considered similar, only the most extreme hard-liners could view READY OR NOT as anything more than good demented fun. Much of the primary production was filmed on location at the Parkwood Estate in Ontario, and it's the perfect setting for a family that chooses murder and fortune over all else. Two standouts on the soundtrack include ""The Hide and Seek Song"" by Headquarters Music and ""Love Me Tender"" by Stereo Jane (definitely not Elvis). For those who enjoy the twisted comedy approach to in-law jokes and violence, there are plenty of macabre moments that will deliver a smile ... till death do us part.",positive
Story is the key here. It has to be logical in the framework of the story and it is. Things tie up. Comic bits are not frequent but they are spontaneous. The pace is good not running out of steam. Kept me interested till the end. It's also nice not to see monsters and zombies for a change. Samara Weaving as the new daughter in law isn't stunningly beautiful which makes her right for the role. Adam Brody is likeable. Andie Macdowell suits the role of Mother in law in a Morticia like way. Not a bad watch at all.,positive
"I didn't watch a gem, nor a great movie, not even for this genre so excuse me if I don't have the same opinion as the people that thought it was an exceptional movie. It's watchable, that I'll admit, there is a bit of suspense, but other than that it's just not a movie I would keep in my collection. Horror and comedy can work but in this case I would just have skipped the comedy part. It was unnecessary and to be honest not that funny. The acting was good for some but bad for others, so even that was disappointing. I read somewhere reviewers comparing it to Get Out, really? If you never seen that one I recommend you that movie. Get Out has everything this movie doesn't have. That's a good movie and not this one.",negative
"Till death do us part.I could have avoided one of my failed marriage if I had never married into her family in the first place. However, at that time, I never thought to look at the family to see the warning signs.In Ready or Not, young Grace (Samara Weaving) is ready to marry Alex (Mark O'Brien) not knowing the La Domas family, although their being super wealthy from board games might help her over the ignorance. As they are scheduled to play an initiation game of Hide and Seek for her, it becomes clear it's deadly enough to demand her life before dawn or they all die.Elements of Get Out, Clue, and Rosemary's Baby help make Ready or Not one of the best horror movies of the year with a little scare for everyone. If an audience is interested in blood and surprise, with a slight bit of the supernatural, then this macabre fest is for them.If, however, like me, an audience looks for social and cultural commentary in addition to the scares, then this nervous experience more than fulfills that requirement. The film shows two ways a bride should be on alert: 1. Wealth has a way of making the wealthy unpredictable, self-centered, and wicked. 2. Why a fiancé has estranged himself from his family is an important piece of information that may save a bride's life.The usual jump-scare tropes and malicious surprises make Ready or Not a delight for the normal horror fan. The cautionary-tale about knowing thy fiancé's family is universally true here. The over-the-top gore that induces laughs makes this film a joy to any filmgoer who can suspend disbelief and love this genre for its ability to teach about life's ironies and dark sides.",positive
"More successfully deployed is the wacky tone that is against the grain of the default somber and grisly timbre, the persecutors are not cynical, morbid sickos but gormless Wasp ne'er-do-wells, who are set out to kill only to save their own skin, thus introduces risible characters like the drug-popping, lethally accident-prone Emilie Le Domas (Scrofano), and her cheekily skeptical, shiftless husband Fitch (Brunn), who can languidly take his time to google how to use a crossbow"" amidst the hair-raising hunting game.""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore",positive
"After watching the first tedious half hour of Ready or Not I began to wonder if it was really the kick-ass comedy-horror movie of the trailer, so I took a look at the IMDB reviews. And I discovered, much to my confusion, that no one seemed to agree on whether the movie was a comedy or a horror movie. Some felt it was comedy-horror, but others felt it was a horror movie with a few comedy bits (that some liked and some didn't).Having watched the movie I now understand. The movie has scenes that are definitely comedic involving the ridiculous characters and some startling moments of comedic violence. And the movie has scenes of grim struggle and peril. But these scenes don't particularly feel like they're part of the same movie, and there's no integration of the two elements; no moments that are scary but funny or funny but scary.For me, the funny parts are quite good. But I found the horror elements intrusive in the way some reviewers here found the comedy elements intrusive. Which parts you find bothersome will be a matter, perhaps, or your expectations.By the halfway point I started fast forwarding through the horror bits just to see how it all turned out.There is a good comedy-horror movie trapped inside Ready or Not. There's also a decent B horror movie trapped in there. The two movies don't get along.The cast is quite good, particularly protagonist Samara Weaving, who has an intensity that makes her interesting even before things get crazy.To summarize: Boring first half hour, some really good comedy horror, some non-comedy horror that I guess is okay for that sort of thing, pretty good ending.Not recommended.",negative
"This movie tries and fails at basically everything. it wasn't funny or creepy or scary. the gore was decent a few times. but there is really nothing here. so many dumb things happen, so you think maybe it's the kind of movie you shouldn't take seriously and just go with it. but then it switches to a serious scene. this happens repeatedly, it doesn't know what it wants to be. tone is all over the place. dialogue is terrible. samara weaving was good. that's about it.

"For me, the comedy in 'Ready Or Not (2019)' isn't all that successful. It's never particularly funny and its attempts at humour sometimes, but only sometimes, reduce immersion. Usually, however, this isn't an issue. The tone is pretty much spot-on for the knowingly absurd narrative, turning what could've been a self-serious and, therefore, seriously silly affair into a near inside joke with its tongue planted firmly in its cheek. The beauty of it all is that there's never an attempt to undercut the weight of the situation. It's a fight for survival, on both sides, and it's as messy as you'd expect. In fact, the comedic beats often serve more as character insights than anything else, allowing the piece to build an interesting and relatively realistic set of core players. Most characters react as you'd expect them to, which is rarer than you'd think. Also, the villainous family are given much more time and nuance than the trailers seemed to indicate. Everyone has an understandable mindset, even if it's violent and deranged, and a few key folk undergo some serious character arcs that are expertly established and surprisingly executed. Generally, the flick follows a predictable formula but it has more than enough charm to account for this. It becomes somewhat repetitive as it goes on but it's always compelling and its finale is subversively satisfying. There's not as much focus on 'fight-back revenge' as I anticipated, which actually makes for a more intriguing time. Where everything ends up is a shock, but it's built to so naturally that it feels inevitable. The whole thing is just so grounded, probably the most relatable version possible. It's entertaining throughout and it's always smiling alongside you. That doesn't mean that it misses out on the pain such a piece requires. There are several moments that should make you wince and the protagonist is certainly put through the wringer, both inside and out. The overall message is slightly muddled - though, to say why would be a spoiler - and the ending may just have been better if it went in another, hinted-at direction (mainly when it comes to clarifying what seems to be the movie's initial intent). Still, there are underlying themes which are interesting to explore retrospectively and the consistent focus on character is commendable. The experience, as it is, is both enjoyable and believable. Its story is purposefully silly, wonderfully so, and it's handled with a fantastic balance of humour and gravitas. I actually buy everything the affair is selling. I think I like it more now than I did just after the credits had rolled. There's never a dull moment, really. It's remarkably consistent entertainment. 7/10",positive
"I am not particularly a huge fan of war films. Much of it is because they too often glamorize war or present bullet-proof heroes who are anything but realistic. However, I am glad I watched ""1917"" because neither of these problems exist in the story plus it's a very good depiction of war and the awfulness of it...particularly WWI.The story is very simple...two lance corporals are sent on a mad dash across enemy territory to alert troops on the other side of this no-man's land that they are walking into a trap. The film shows their journey and the thrilling finale.The plot is among the simplest I've seen in a war film and the movie is really about action and the men's struggle to sneak across the battlefield and alert their troops....simple. Yet it was made so thoughtfully and realistically that it really worked well. A brilliantly made film...among the best I've seen about war. But it's also very graphic and unpleasant....so be forewarned.",positive
"Sam Mendes' 1917 is, like DUNKIRK before it, a visually impressive but ultimately hollow viewing experience. I mean, I love tracking shots in cinema, but this is just one after another and the effective becomes diluted and underwhelming after a time. The film is at its best when the characters are picking their way through labyrinthine trenches in some stunning visual moments, and there are some CGI-aided set-pieces which are phenomenal too. A great film to look at, then, which brings to life the battlegrounds of WW1 in a way that few films can. A shame that there's virtually no story to go with the visuals. Mendes decided to do the writing himself, which was a mistake, and the characters are dull and paper-thin despite the actors trying their best. There's suspense in the first half, then a great twist, but this proves to be the highlight of the film as things go downhill afterwards. The nadir is the bit where the protagonist forgets his mission to coo at a baby for ten minutes. At this point it's just treading water until the end thankfully comes.",negative
"Lance Corporals Blake and Schofield are given an urgent message by General Erinmore to deliver to a cut-off unit to stop a planned attack. They travel across abandoned German positions and across German lines facing many dangers.This is directed by Sam Mendes with cinematography by the great Roger Deakins. It's a faux continuous shot. It's masterfully filmed. The tension is more limited until the action starts. It tries to raise the emotional content after the plane crash. It would work better if Blake starts as the main character. It could have been a great shock. That's what this movie lacks. It doesn't have the bite of great twists and turns other than the great resolution. Nevertheless, this is an exceptionally filmed war action movie and that it is worth every penny.",positive
"The command has realized that the Germans have pulled back for a trap on a British offensive. The telephone lines are cut, and the only way to get the orders through to the colonel commanding the offensive is to send two soldiers through the lines. One of them has special incentive. His elder brother is a soldier in the attack. If it goes through, 1600 men, will be wiped out for no purpose.... including the soldier's brother.It's a classic story-telling format that dates back to the ANABASIS: get from point A to Point B, only here it's just two men traveling through the alternating inferno of the Great War's front lines, and the bucolic springtime of northern France. Effective as that is, director Sam Mendes and cinematographer Roger Deakins have shot it, as near as they could manage, as one long take - after I had realized what they were doing, about twenty minutes into the film, I began to look for ways of editing things together. While I spotted a few, there was really only one obvious spot, and that was after more than an hour had passed.This deliberate effort to make this movie in this manner clearly has a point. It is a constant barrage, one long cinematic sentence that must be swallowed whole. It forces the viewer to take it all in in one piece, giving, perhaps, a hint of the overwhelming sensory overload of this struggle to get through.It certainly worked on me.",positive
"1917 is a new movie, an American/British co-production from 2019, that was directed by Oscar winner Sam Mendes and he is also one of the two writers in charge of the script here, which is definitely not usual at all because this is his very first writing credit and this really makes me say: ""Why oh why Sam did you not start penning film scripts earlier?"" The outcome is really good and after seeing it, I am not too surprised that it is one of the big players this awards season and really took ceremonies by storm lately the way it won Best Drama at the Golden Globes, in what was definitely considered an upset. And won the PGA Award not much later. So you can probably say that this is the film to beat at the Oscars, even if Tarantino is also still in a good spot and I must say even if I liked this film here, I like Tarantino's work still a bit more. I still think it is better than Scorsese's newest as well as the overrated Parasite. But we talked about that one on another occasion.Now let me say a bit about these almost two hours we have here. The number in the title is of course a reference to the year 1917, during which World War I was still taking place, so this is a war movie from beginning to end and that makes it even more surprising that I really liked it you can say because this is perhaps my least favorite genre. So if you enjoy war-themed movies you will like this one even more. Then again, seeing all the horror, it is probably more of an anti-war film than a war movie by definition, just like Apocalypse Now for example. The cast includes some big names, but at the center of it all there are two young actors in the first half, and one of them in the second half and both are no big names. So a similar approach to Nolan's (overrated) Dunkirk, but even there the famous actors (like Hardy) had more screen time. The somewhat big names here are Firth (early on) and Cumberbatch (at the end) and maybe you will recognize Andrew Scott too, who is part of it early on. Or Mark Strong. Firth I liked. He usually plays sensitive characters, but he can pull off ""tough"" as well. Cumberbatch I just cannot see as a gritty soldier, especially not as the one who commands a unit, come on. Then again I don't think too highly of him as an actor anyway. Scott and Strong were fine.Now a few words, however, on the two young actors at the center here. They really deserve to be mentioned because they did a fine job. The one who is really in it from beginning to end reminded me physically of the young Andreas Lust and I cannot imagine I am the only German/Austrian who thought so. Anyway, this film is (a bit like Birdman) one shot basically from beginning to end. The action just blacks out in those moments when one character is unconscious or otherwise the camera moves away from the characters and this way they could have made it work. Of course, this was not all recorded in 2 hours and then it's a wrap. But it feels that way and that is why it is a success. It is so nicely written, I said that before, but it deserves to be said again. There are many very good moments that show how much attention to detail is included in this film. Just pay attention to how the guys are joking about trying to do a parody of a superior officer, but our hero just sits there with a really sad face expression due to what happened a little earlier. Or also this refers for example to the frame that includes how the older from the two sits in the grass next to a tree very early on and then also after the film when his big mission is over and he managed to warn the batallion. Or the mouse/rat scene with the animal falling down and running away and this way causing the explosion. Now that was really one of the most tense moments of the film, also how one character saves the other's life after that.Or not much later when we have the scene with the German pilot and his knife and he actually stabs one of the two and kills him before getting shot himself and this was such a shocking moment when you realize the kind-hearted boy from the two, who loves telling stories and who has a brother he loves very much and who has a mother/family that owns a garden etc., is actually about to die because you thought it is his mission to save his brother and everybody else in his batallion, but nope: It is the other who moves to the center of it all consequently and if you take a look at how he questions the entire mission after almost being killed and asks his friend why oh why did he pick him, there was some slight foreshadowing you can say. Oh well, I say that now. When the other kid was killed (in what was even a tragically altruist death because he, unlike the final one central character who just wanted to let him die, tried to save the enemy soldier's life and got attacked immediately afterwards), I did not think about it like that at all, so it is also a very surprising movie. Anyway, the one central character finally accepted the difficult task as we see when he pushed the other soldiers to really get the car moving out of the mud. Unfortunately, this was also the last scene of the film that really really impressed me and when he leaves this group, it gets a bit worse (or not as good anymore as everything before that I would say). Probably it is just personal taste, but the scenes with the French woman and child as well as all the German soldiers did not do that much for me sadly, even if they were technically flawless. There is no denying there. Also let me say that in these parts they nicely elaborated on the man vs. man (1v1) component and that was definitely executed convincingly, most of all the scene with one soldier who fires at our hero from far above.It stays a tense movie for sure, it just goes one step back from great to good I would say and then there is Cumberbatch too, which is not helping. Okay he is not bad or anything, but everything/everybody else is just better. Let me put it like that. So sadly, when eventually he meets his late buddy's brother, who is alive and well, it was not as emotional for me as it could have been. Nonetheless, I want to say again that there are so many quality moments that are also informative like when we find out why the Germans killed the cows or that there are soldiers in the British army with all kinds of ethnicities and colors and that made them strong too because the Germans (obviously with their take on race) do not have that. Two more things I want to mention are the really really good soundtrack and it would be nice if that one wins the Oscar and not the one from Joker and the second thing is the high-level cinematography. Roger Deakins. Do I need to say more? Glad that he does not have to wait for his second Oscar as long as for his first. He is safe for the win really. Finally, a few words on the two young men again. I think it has been a while since I saw a better example of friendship in film with how they interact and support each other and even save each other at times. And how of course the main character's journey was not only to save his comrades, but also to fulfill his friend's last wish and with that I do not only mean the letter to the mother.But even in the face of all that, we should not forget that our hero has his own fate and family and does not only exist to fulfill the fallen's last wish(es). We see that with the photos at the very end and the wish written on them. Also much better this way really than maybe them coming up with a romance story with the French girl or so. The film did not need that. But it needed their inclusion and we see that even with all the soldiers dying, there were also so so many casualties in the simple population (away from the military branch), such as probably also the baby's mother. Tragedy wherever you look. Every corpse you see, no matter which side he fought on or if he fought on any at all, had their own story. This film is really important because it reminds us of the cruelties of war and we should try all we can to make sure these times will stay a thing of the past for as long as mankind exists. And at the same time it tells us a captivating story about those affected by it all. I can only say I liked this one much more than ""Black Hawk Down"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"", films that have been considered classics for a long time, so even if you (like myself) are not too much into war movies, you should check it out, preferrably on the big screen at your local theater. There are so many scenes that are far more effective there (like the rat/mouse scene for example) than on a laptop/television screen. Go for it. Don't miss out. Great job by Mendes and everybody else!",positive
"Sam Mendes has made a technically bravura film which looks like one long take. Something he experimented with at the beginning of his James Bond movie, Spectre.Made by Dreamworks, the company's first shot for the Best Picture Oscar was Saving Private Ryan in 1998.The story is about two soldiers in World War One. Their mission is to make their way across no man's land, the abandoned German lines and reach the advancing Allied troops. They have to deliver a message ordering them not to attack as they are walking into a trap set by the Germans who want to give the impression that they are retreating.One of the soldiers has good reason to take this perilous mission. His brother is part of the Allied group and is in danger. Therefore the story owes a nod to Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan.Impressively photographed by Roger Deakins, it sets out to show the dirty horrors of trench warfare. The story though is slight and gets lost with the style of filmmaking that Mendes has employed.I thought it lacked the verve of Peter Weir's Gallipoli, a film which I kept thinking off when I watched 1917. This might be the reason that although it went into the Oscars as a frontrunner, it lost out on the main prizes.",positive
"In April, 1917, Lance Corporals Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay) are assigned to cross a no man's land and a German line to deliver a message from General Erinmore (Colin Firth) to Colonel Mackenzie (Benedict Cumberbatch) calling off an attack to the German front. The military intelligence had concluded that the Germans have prepared a mortal trap that will kill one thousand and six hundred soldiers including Blake's big brother Lieutenant Joseph Blake (Richard Madden). Will they succeed in their journey?""1917"" is a good war movie but overrated with the nomination to the Oscar. The masterpiece ""Paths of Glory"" is also based on a World War I drama and is better and better, but was not nominated to the Oscar. ""Joyeux Noël"" that is also better than ""1917"" at least was nominated to the Oscar. ""1917"" has good direction, performances, sets and special effects and is also worthwhile watching. But not with the expectation of an Oscar nominated film. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""1917""",positive
"This is an impressive bit of filmmaking, and it won 3 Oscars for just that - however the areas of the wins are quite telling and fit with my experience of watching it. The wins were all technical in nature, which is fitting because 1917 is a film that very much impresses on its delivery first, and its content a reasonably distant second. It is sort of understandable, because the central plot is about rushed forward motion, and this does mean limited opportunity for the film is flesh out its characters and scenario. It does have a go at it, and does reasonably well, but mostly this aspect is a weakness.In terms of tension and thrills, it does well at its best, producing many good set-pieces through the run-time. The downside of this is that sustained periods without big moments, or engaging smaller drama, do give an up/down feeling to the pace of delivery. Broadly though, it flows well and takes the viewer along with it. Main reason though was the technical delivery. I am a sucker for a ""single-shot"" delivery, so I was already open to loving this film on that basis alone. Okay it is not one single take so much as a series of takes (longest of which is 8 minutes), but this is still hugely impressive and it gives the film the sense of movement and momentum that the narrative benefits from. Cinematography, lighting, sound, editing, effects - all the technical aspects come together impressively and it enough to carry the film over the weaknesses in other areas. The cast occasionally distract by virtue of their fame, but mostly they work well, and the two young leads sell their situations well.Overall though, I still ended the film thinking about the technical aspects than I was about the characters or the film as a whole - which isn't a good situation. When I watched The Irishman, I quickly stopped noticing the de-aging technology and just got into the film; however here the same didn't happen consistently - I found I was broken out of the film and was focused on the camera movement, editing etc.",positive

"It's over seventy years since Alfred Hitchcock made Rope, which tried to tell a thrilling tale of murder in a swanky New York apartment location with as few shots as possible, the director hiding any sneaky splices with clever visual trickery. For First World War adventure 1917, Sam Mendes pulls off the same illusion, only with the advantages of 21st century technology, meaning that his film is far more seamless and able to cover much more ground: the vast, body-strewn battlegrounds of northern France, to be precise, where Lance Corporal Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Lance Corporal Schofield (George MacKay) are given the unenviable task of delivering a letter to advancing British troops heading into a trap that could cost 1,600 lives.There's no denying that 1917 is an amazing technical feat, with many an impressive shot as Blake and Schofield risk life and limb to head into enemy territory. Director Mendes and cinematographer Roger Deakins pull off the seemingly impossible on many occasions, the camera gliding and sweeping over muddy war-torn terrain, in and out of trenches, and through numerous ruins, rarely leaving the protagonists, clearly the result of much planning and impeccable timing. As such, 1917 is, for the most part, an incredibly immersive experience, putting the viewer right in the thick of it with the heroes, the action both intense and visceral. Occasionally, however, it's all just a little too clever for its own good, with a few moments that are so technically jaw-dropping that they tend to draw the viewer out of the film wondering how the shots were achieved. It's a double-edged sword, that movie-making wizardry!The simplistic script also works for and against the film. I liken the story-line to that of a 'first-person shooter' computer game, where the player controls a character who must complete a mission, overcoming various hazards and enemies along the way, There's not exactly a lot of depth to it -- it's about getting from A to B without being killed, and that's pretty much it. On the flip side, the minimalistic plot does mean that there's a fair amount of action to be had, so I'm not complaining too much. I do have a couple of minor niggles, though -- and considering the incredible attention to detail given to the visuals, I wish that Mendes and co-writer Krysty Wilson-Cairns had managed to write their way round these issues a little better: firstly, trusting a German pilot who has just been shot out of the sky.... stupid, stupid, stupid. Number two: milk... just sitting there for the taking, with no-one else around (and how convenient for a touching scene later on). And lastly, a whole battalion sat listening to someone sing, with no-one on look-out - it's like they're asking to be shot!Despite its problems, I would still recommend the film, especially to those interested the whole process of film-making -- the sets, the costumes, the carefully choreographed action, and the camerawork are astounding, and worth the price of admission alone. If you become invested in the characters and their mission, then that's just a bonus.7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",positive
"This is a really good movie, it is less about typical war battles, it is about a two man team given the do or die assignment to deliver an important message to a British regiment prepared to launch an attack the next morning. The lives of 1600 men are at stake. As such the camera follows the men through trenches and across the countryside almost in real time, viewing it you feel that you are the third person in the mission. The camera is either following closely, or leading closely, or close off to the side. It required exact choreography, almost like a complicated ballet, and very much rehearsal time was required before filming. The DVD extras show a few of the complicated cinematography techniques used, like crew carrying a camera up to a point then placing it onto a type of crane to finish the shot, all uninterrupted. To me the cinematography is the real star of the movie.This is the first time Sam Mendes scripted a movie, he based the ideas on stories told to him in the 1970s, stories of his grandfather's own experiences in WW1. So while the story is fiction it is based on typical WW1 activities and experiences.My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. A quite interesting glimpse at what WW1 was like.",positive
"Right, well I took my time getting around to watching this movie, but eventually got the chance to sit down and watch it.Let me just start by saying that the movie is enjoyable and watchable, for sure. Especially the first 35 minutes of the movie, because it really shows how gritty, ugly and atrocious war is. And the way that whole part of the movie was set up was just amazing.Then the next 25 minutes, the movie started to gear down, as the two characters were trekking about. Sure, it was still enjoyable. Then the last hour of the movie it just fell into mediocrity, and the movie never got out of that slump. And it was a shame, because it was off to such a marvelous start.This movie is no ""Saving Private Ryan"", although there are similarities, for sure. But they are two very different movies, both in story and entertainment value.I watched the movie, and was adequately entertained, however, I can't say that this is a movie that I will be returning to watch a second time around, because the movie just didn't have that much to offer. And those glorious 35 minutes in the start of the movie just didn't stretch to salvage the rest of the movie.It should be said that the acting in the movie was adequate. Sure, this is not a movie that is heavy of thespian acting performances, but the people were doing good enough jobs with their given roles. But I really don't think that anyone were given any proper chance to shine and stand out in throughout the course of the movie.Visually, then ""1917"" was good. It was a dirty and gritty movie, definitely making it feel like an authentic WW1 movie, and it did feel like you were right there in the muck with the soldiers.My rating for the movie was initially going to be a 6 out of 10 stars, but because of the sliding down into mediocrity, then the movie settles on a 5 out of 10 stars from me. While it is watchable and enjoyable enough for what it turned out to be, it was by no means a milestone in war story cinema.",negative
"Sam Mendes in 1917 gives us his variation on the old adage, ""if you think you're going through hell, keep going,"" and for all of the given technical prowess - and a 70 year old Roger Deakins showing with a big grin that he's still got one of the most massive cinematography you-know-whats in the industry - I didn't feel much while watching this, except the occasional ""oof"" or ""ugh"" (usually when seeing some of the first dead bodies and rats). It's a conceptual piece that means to be a major statement on the horrors of war, and it only reminds me that the films about war that have stayed with me more than any are the ones that provide visceral and complicated characters FIRST, craft wizardry SECOND (or at least concurrently).I thought at some point I might compare it to how a war-like video game works (I dont have a lot of experience playing these sorts of first-person shooters, Im just going by assumption), and to Mendes's credit he tries to slow things down here and there so it isnt all thrill-a-minute action and spectacle. But it does carry that sense of the mission these two are on and the sort of ""stuff"" that happens is more interesting than getting to know them (and when we briefly do, it's unremarkable, maybe a sign of why Mendes doesn't usually write his own films).It's a somewhat precarious position to be in as one in the audience, since objectively I know what everyone on the crew did to make this come off, from the art direction to the props to how goddamn realistically-based the camera is (or I should say like 80% of the time), yet by the end it means to lay an emotional punch to the gullet, and I just didn't connect.Maybe some will, or maybe some will be even more bothered by what is clearly, as far as elevator pitches go, an attempt to one-up Kubrick with Paths of Glory (I van almost hear Mendes in his head as he shoots this going, ""hah, take that and your trench tracking shots!"") via the near-one take approach of Rope. But, again, those films had scripts that were engaging completely on the scale of what horrors human beings do to one another on an individual scale, with the system as a cudgel, not to mention enormously moving performances (same with another film that did this far better, Birdnlman, for its theatricality). This is kind of a... Forced-Poetic idea of a tragic story, impeccably made but hollow at its heart.For all the impressive filmmaking brio on display, I unfortunately have a sinking feeling this may win best director and best picture at the Oscars not for exactly being a ""best"" but for being the ""most"" film (or trying to be). And as for it being an anxiety-filled experience... Folks, c'mon, Uncut Gems is in a theater right next door to this one at your local cineplex .",negative
"In the same way that I'm dispositioned to despise anyone from Upper St. Clair or Mt. Lebanon - Pittsburgh-centric content, yinz guys - I'm also usually on high alert to dislike Oscar bait like this film. So let me get all my vitriol out of my system before it begins: for a movie that people are proclaiming as a human experience of war, all I could see were the technological advancements and filmmaking tricks that allowed for the continuous shot style of the first half of this movie.It's fine. It was up for the biggest prizes in movie making and yep. It's a fine movie. It has no real soul or reason for you to watch it more than once, but this may be more of an indictment of this reviewer than this film.It left me cold and I felt like I was begging it for warmth. Just a casual outline of the events of the movie seem like they could be moments worth viewing, such as the choice to save or murder the downed German pilot. Instead, they are just moments.Sam Mendes has had a wonderful run so far, between his highly regarded James Bond films, Jarhead, Road to Perdition and American Beauty. He has an eye for huge visuals and the ability to tell a great story. This isn't a small movie, despite really only centering on one character's experience in the war.I probably enjoyed the scenes with the drunken soldiers blessing Schofield and Blake before they ventured into No Man's Land more than anything else in the movie. Although I wonder what the narrative point is of the film, which informs us at the end that everything that the leads have endured was truly for nothing, as the orders will probably change in the next week. This is not the first movie I've watched recently that offered little to no hope. Or maybe that was just life itself.Again - I felt like this movie was an awesome technical achievement. Perhaps the self-congratulatory nature of Hollywood and the press put me off, as I didn't need to hear its creators sing its praises so much. Or perhaps a steady diet of Mexican, Phillipino, Hong Kong and Italian junk movies have eroded my movie watching abilities, only allowing me to savor movies where black-gloved madmen strangle women and gas-guzzling mutants rise from the grave.Probably.

"I love Taika Waititi's work...so it's not too surprising that I'd want to see ""Jojo Rabbit""...his latest and strangest film project. His previous work, such as ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" and ""What We Do in the Shadows"", really impressed me. In light of this, it's very sad that I wasn't particularly impressed with ""Jojo""....though I must admit it was well crafted.The problem for me is that the film really ISN'T a drama nor a comedy. A few things, such as Sam Rockwell's outfit near the end of the film, simply are surreal and senseless. If you're looking for a hilarious movie, well, with all the death and Hitler in it, it's not the least bit funny. If you want a serious drama about the final months of the Third Reich, well, the film is often too light and carefree....an unusual case where the movie fails on both accounts with me.

"Jojo Rabbit tells the story of the final days of World War II through the eyes of a child. To be specific a member of the Hitler Youth.

If they hadn't started the European portion of World War II who knows how long they could have stayed with a whole generation of youth indocrinated as it was.As with youth all over the world Davies is subject to peer pressure. He's not the most athletically inclined kid around and has a problem with the physical stuff. He has however an imaginary friend. The Fuehrer himself played by director Taika Waititi encourages him on.

When the lad discovers this it puts him on the horns of a dilemma.Part drama, part comedy, part satire, Jojo Rabbit has something to appeak to all tastes.

ScarJo is terrific. There are some big-time emotional gut punches. There are surprising turns. This is one of the year's best.",positive
"It is a precise diagnosis for present. Touching , poetic, subjective in profound sense, naive, off course.In same measure, it is well crafted satire. And a nice- bitter parable.And a challenge, scene by scene. The prize is the parallel between the performance of young Roman Griffin Davis and David Bennent in The Tin Drum or Archie Yates and Danuel Pipoly in The Lord of Flies. Short, that kind of film easy to define as useful for part of its public or boring, supperficial, violent for others. . Because it seems too much,it is heartfelt and precise and its purpoise, so obvious is just to discover, in its fundamental traits and its nuances, the near reality. So, provocative in many senses.",positive
"Roman Griffin Davis is looking forward to a week at Hitler Youth Camp. When he fails to demonstrate his dedication to ethnic purity and Nazi ideals by breaking the neck of a rabbit, the rest of the campers start call young Johannes -- that's Master Davis -- ""Jojo Rabbit"". He runs off, naturally, and confers with his goofy imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler, who informs him of the ferocity of rabbits. So Roman runs back, where Sam Rockwell is about to give all the boys a chance to throw a grenade, grabs one, and winds up scarring his face and behind. When he gets out of the hospital, his mother, Scarlett Johansson knees Rockwell in the ... well, it's not the behind.All perfectly normal in the year 1945, as the Thousand Year Reich's ever victorious army is being shredded, with Russian, American, British, and probably Chinese armies are about to march on the town. It's when Roman discovers that his mother is hiding Thomasina McKenzie, a Jew, in the floorboards behind his dead sister's room, that things begin to get odd. She takes his knife away from him, but they eventually reach a stalemate, because if Miss Johannsson finds out he's found out, then Elsie will have to go. So instead, he begins quizzing her on her diabolical schemes to take over the world, where are the horns on her head * and so forth. It gradually begins to dawn on him that he may not have understood reality perfectly up to now, which is startling for a boy who has achieved the great age of ten and a half to realize.It's a weird movie about children being asked to grow up too fast. The only movie that feels at all like it is THE DEATH OF STALIN, and this feels way weirder to me. After all, one of my grandfathers was a communist, but everyone agreed that Hitler was the worst person ever. It was so obvious that even the goyim had figured it out, although it took them a war to reach the startling conclusion that someone who had been screaming about Jews, Slavs, Blacks and homosexuals for more than twenty years, and who had killed, oh, all of them he could manage, might not be the nicest guy in the world. It's certainly upsetting to think of him as a goofy imaginary friend.I know what you're thinking. You're thinking ""here's an American Jew who grew up in the aftermath of the Second World War, when about a third of his family had been killed in the Holocaust -- which some of you deny ever happened -- so he has issues! It's not like some one vile, like Justin Trudeau, John Wayne, or Walt Disney, was a goofy imaginary friend, which is impossible, because they were evil incarnate.""Well, we all have issues, don't we? This is one weird movie. Is it a great movie? It's a weird one. * A question I got asked in Colorado in 1971",positive
"Jojo Rabbit is a new American 2019 movie and one of the big players this awards season. First of all, I want to say that it is quite ironic that this film came out pretty much the same time here like a film based on a famous German book about a pink rabbit, but international readers have most likely no clue what I am talking about, so I won't go any further into detail about that. Instead, let's elaborate on these slightly over 105 minutes we have here. Director Waititi is a big star in Hollywood now already obviously as he also gave us his take on the Marvel universe, but this film here is the one that means even more breakthrough for him. He is also credited as the one and only writer who adapted the novel into the screenplay. If it wasn't for Peter Jackson, you could also say that he is the biggest filmmaker from New Zealand ever already, even if he missed out on the Academy Award nomination for Best Director, but he was probably close. The only acting nomination for the Oscars went to Scarlett Johansson and it seems the Academy wants to make it up this year for her by giving her two nominations even after ignoring her for so long. This one here is also her better shot at the win, even if both are very unlikely.Lead actor Roman Griffin Davis, who plays the title character, was nominated for a Golden Globe despite his young age. I am not too mad about that. He was pretty good for sure and especially in the second half, he almost carried the film solely on his shoulders with Johansson and Waititi out of the picture. Yes, Waititi also acts in here. You can see on the poster which character he plays. I am not sure I can write the name and my review will get through. Then again, he does not really play the character, he just plays how a young boy perceives said character if he was his best friend. Sadly, while Waititi was incredibly funny and gave a great performance and also I think had he had more screen time, then he could have been nominated for a supporting Oscar too, I struggled with the way they included him. The things he said frequently felt just written and for the sake of it and not what a boy would make out of them, if he was really a figment of his imagination. This applies especially to the Churchill scene you can also see in the trailer, but also the last appearance from said character when the boy almost banned him out of his mind felt out of place. By then, clearly all his sympathies were gone, so they simply should not have had him return, even if the way he got kicked through the window was pretty epic and funny (like Tarantino blowing himself up in ""Django Unchained""). Don't get me wrong, I think the character added a great deal of entertainment and Waititi gave a really good performance, but in the overall picture it did not feel right to me beyond entertainment.The cast includes other familiar faces too: Sam Rockwell is doing fine as always and his two acts of kindness stay in the mind. He did not have too much screen time, but when he was on, he was really commanding and you can see why he is an Oscar winner now. I still think he looks way younger than he is. By the way, he was gay in this movie, wasn't he? So he had his own tragic story too that we did not find out too much about. Rebel Wilson is just in it for some funny punchlines and that is alright. She is easy to recognize in every film she is in, but great range she has not, especially not when it goes beyond comedy. But the audience in my showing clearly loved her and I can't deny Waititi wrote her as good as it gets. At the end, we find out that, unlike Rockwell's character, there is really no hope for her soul. Proud Nazi until the very end. Now I already said RDG was pretty good in the lead, but the one I liked even more was Archie Yates. I am not yet sure if it was his performance or just his material, but this kid was a riot honestly. Every scene with him was a winner and I hope I can see him in other projects soon. In general, they did a great job with the casting here. Nobody feels that they could not work the part and I also include Thomasin McKenzie with that. She gets more screen time the longer the film goes and while her story is definitely the most dramatic from all characters involved, she has lighter moments like everybody else. I just wondered why she really believed these letters came from her boyfriend and how she really knew towards the end that he was dead if she did not even know who won the war. Oh well, minor script flaws, but this one still has a shot to win an Oscar there. Script and maybe costumes are the only shots the film has really. Still more than most others. I do think the script would not be undeserving.This film peaks especially with the dialogue writing (there are so many examples, not just Waititi's character), but also those moments when the girl towards the end steps out into the light and can leave the house again without having to fear death. Or the many excellent ways in which Waititi breathed life into the clash between innocent childhood and the cruel world around them. How the boy says near the end that the Germans won and that she must stay was just one example. It had nothing to do with him being evil, just with him being afraid of losing her. Or when he attacks her with the knife and the wound is almost non-existent. All this shows he is a good boy, also because of the way he was raised. He loves his mother dearly and does not see her as an opponent (except the ""rat"" moment maybe), even if he is not happy about her not telling him about the hidden girl. We see him cry so hard when the mother is dead. There are serious moments for sure, but still I think young people can and should watch this film. So does Johansson's character early on when she shows him these people who were murdered for not supporting the Nazis. This is one from a handful scary scenes. Rockwell's final moment. How they turn poor children into soldiers... Another would be right at the very start, the scene with the rabbit, the one that gives Johannes the nickname we see in the film's title. Again this scene shows that he is not evil or cold-blooded and his only reason for being with the Nazis is that he wants to belong somewhere. He basically just repeats what he hears, the best example is all about the Jews really that he also wrote in his book. It shows that he is curious and wants to make up his mind himself when asking the girl about her kind. He does no longer want to just blindly accept what other people say.Speaking of the girl, this scene with Merchant's character (seeing him first in the trailer I thought it was Lars Eidinger) is among the most memorable from this film. Of course, it is incredibly tense and scary, but it is also over the top (in an entertaining way) and really funny near the end when we see what Jojo wrote and painted about Nathan, the girl's boyfriend. The butterfly scene from before that also stays in the mind. Or the chubby kid's words (for example ""not a good time to be a Nazi"" he was really good in making the simplest statements about really complicated aspects and they still felt real). So yes, this film definitely has far more positive to offer than negative. There were scenes and moments that did not feel too authentic and realistic to me, like some quotes by Jojo felt more from a grown-up and written than actually from a boy his age, which is maybe my biggest criticism. Or how he finds the girl I struggled a bit with. Yes he is a curious boy, but that was really too much effort if you ask me. Or the physical conflict between the two when the girl shows him her strength and that the Germans/Nazis are not really superior in terms of strength. It's not a perfect film, but one that is highly entertaining and stays very memorable too. And even with the sad aspects like Johansson's character dying, it is not a depressing film. The boy lost his mother, but remember he is not an orphan. His dad is still out there somewhere and he can probably return eventually. Or that he basically, one way or the other, has a sister again with what the two went through together that will always unite them. So it is also an uplifting film. This also has to do for sure with what Waititi had in mind about people all ages that should see the film. He certainly succeeded and he would not have, had he turned this into a super depressing political or (anti-) war movie without light moments whatsoever. Instead it is these light moments that dominate the film. Sometimes it had a touch of Wes Anderson to me.And don't be distracted by everybody speaking English here despite the film being set in Germany. This was just a decision because they did not want to cast German actors all along and I don't mind or care at all. You can still watch the German dub if that is a problem for you. For me, it was probably only something that slightly confused me for five minutes or so. Okay I guess this would be all then. I think the rating here on imdb is a bit too high and I can see why some critics did not like it too much, but I personally felt it worked really well as a satire, so no hesitation for me in giving this one a thumbs-up and a positive recommendation. It may not be among the best films of 2019, but it certainly is a good achievement and I would say instead, it is among the most different films of the year and truly a unique achievement that oozes creativity and deserves to be checked out for that reason alone. Finally, I want to add as a little closing statement that I watched the film from the perspective of somebody who has not read the book it is based on. I don't think it is necessary at all to do so in order to enjoy the movie, so I cannot talk about differences and parallels between this film and the base material, but I doubt the book is bad or anything if it results into such an interesting film. Certainly closer for me to 4 stars out of 5 (maybe on a rewatch), but for now I will just go with 3.",positive
"Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) is a 10 year old boy in Nazi Germany. A lifetime of indoctrination has given him a hatred of Jews. He has been drafted into the Hitler Youth where he does not fit in. He is nicknamed Jojo Rabbit and bullied by the older boys.His mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) is raising Jojo alone. His father is missing, his sister is dead. He discovers that his mother has been hiding a teenage Jewish girl called Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie) in the attic. To make his life more complicated, he has an imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler (Taika Waititi.)This would had been a brilliant film if the Monty Python team had made it in their prime. If Mel Brooks had made this, he would have added a song and dance number called Springtime for Hitler.Instead Taika Waititi's film left me cold. It had an air of smugness and self congratulation about how zany this movie is. Only Sam Rockwell caught the spirit of the film with his Captain Klenzendorf, a soldier who knows the war is lost. This is such an uneven film and the satire is off target too many times.Eventually Jojo and Elsa reach an understanding but at times I thought I was watching an episode of Allo Allo.",negative
"Jojo Rabbit (Roman Griffin Davis) is part of the Trump Youth Group. He is a ten-year-old boy who likes to dress up, be part of the club and play Nazi. Hitler (Taika Waititi) is his imaginary friend. As the war closes in on Berlin, he discovers a Jew (Thomasin McKenzie) hidden in the closet. His mother (Scarlett Johansson) is part of the resistance.The film depicts the Germans in a comic fashion similar to ""Hogan's Heroes."" In spite of the dark background, the film is mostly light. Sam Rockwell gives us a comical performance.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity.",positive
"I thought this was bags of fun, who said that satire was a thing of the past, Jojo Rabbit prices that it is alive and well..It's one of those films that will have you laughing one minute, crying the next, then awkwardly chuckling in the scene after that.It's very well acted, very well made, the production values are actually very, very strong.I saw this on its release with a few friends, it was my choice, faces were pulled at the thought of it, but everyone enjoyed, one quibbled before the film that she thought it was going to be offensive, it isn't, it's all tongue in cheek.I look forward to seeing it again, I recommend. 8/10.",positive
"Well, it's not ""Schindler's List"", and it might demonstrate a bit of Monty Python inspiration, but at heart this is a biting anti-hate film that uses drama and humor effectively to tell the story of a Nazi youth and a Jewish girl about to discover the world and themselves as part of the human condition. Films like this remind us that the differences that exist among disparate ethnicities or races are almost always an accident of birth, and if left unchallenged, people can generally learn to get along with one another. Young Johannes 'JoJo' Betzler (Roman Griffin Davis) is determined to uphold the will of The Fuehrer in the form of his imaginary friend Adolf (Taika Waititi, who doubles as the film's director), and is left conflicted over the actions of his mother (Scarlett Johansson) when he learns that she's been hiding a teenage Jewish girl in a disguised passageway of their German home. Over time, Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie) and JoJo form a relationship that evolves into friendship, and in JoJo's case, borders on a case of puppy love, all while in the midst of Allied forces about to break the back of the Nazi stranglehold on their home town.You wouldn't think that a film dealing with Hitler would be fodder for comedy, but director Waititi manages to walk a fine line between drama and humor. There will be those viewers who vilify the picture for it's dialog and treatment of Jews, but that's one of the things that always bothers me about a movie's detractors. By showing what occurred at one time in history isn't the same thing as supporting those actions, as deplorable as they might have been. The picture finds it's balance in the caricatured treatment of Nazi villains like Sam Rockwell's Captain Klenzendorf, Gestapo leader Deertz (Stephen Merchant), and the riotous Fraulein Rahm, portrayed by Rebel Wilson. One might even conclude that Klenzendorf, as loyal as he was to the Nazi cause, had at least a spark of humanity by disavowing JoJo in the presence of American soldiers so the young boy wouldn't be considered a Nazi sympathizer.I couldn't think of a more perfect ending for the movie, reminding us of Elsa's promise to dance when she knew that the war was over and that she had finally acquired her freedom. Having survived great personal tragedy with the death of his mother and loss of a sister, JoJo looks himself in the mirror and vows that ""Today, just do what you can"". The closing soundtrack echoes JoJo's sentiments, and those of all people who are inspired to overcome their own unfortunate circumstances, as David Bowie's German lyrics relate how 'We can be heroes, just for one day'.",positive
"I was instantly attracted to this film the first time I saw the trailer, and I had a feeling it was going to have a Marmite reaction, audiences would either love it and go with it, or hate it, written and directed by Taika Waititi (What We Do in the Shadows, Thor: Ragnarok). Basically, Johannes ""Jojo"" Betzler (Golden Globe nominated Roman Griffin Davis) is a ten-year-old boy living in Nazi Germany during the later stages of World War II with his mother, Rosie (Oscar and BAFTA nominated Scarlett Johansson). His father is missing in action on serving on the Italian Front and his older sister Inge recently died of influenza. Jojo, who seems very passionate about Nazism, often talks with his imaginary friend, a supportive but childish version of Adolf Hitler (Taika Waititi). Jojo and his best friend Yorki (Archie Yates) attend a Hitler Youth training camp, run by the one-eyed Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell). When Jojo is ordered to kill a rabbit by older Hitler Youth members, he cannot bring himself to do it, and runs off crying being taunted by the other boys, calling him ""Jojo Rabbit"". After a pep talk from Adolf, Jojo returns and throws a hand grenade without permission. It bounces off a tree and explodes at his feet, leaving him with facial scars and a slight limp. After Jojo recovers, Rosie asks Klenzendorf, demoted after the incident, to make her son feel included despite his injuries. Jojo is given small tasks such as spreading propaganda leaflets throughout town and collecting scrap metal for the war effort. Alone at home one day, Jojo discovers a teenage Jewish girl hiding upstairs, Elsa Korr (Thomasin McKenzie), also his sister's former classmate. Jojo threatens to turn her over to the Gestapo, but Elsa warns that his mother would be killed for hiding her. He agrees to keep her safe, on the condition she reveals her ""Jew secrets"" so he can write a book for Klenzendorf, which amuses him. Elsa plays along and makes up stories that Jews have special powers, such as mind-reading. Jojo is angry with his mother for hiding a Jew, accusing her of being unpatriotic. Rosie dismisses his accusations; she believes that positivity and optimism are the best ways to be free of oppression. Jojo continues to interrogate Elsa, learning she has a boyfriend called Nathan with whom she wants to reunite when the war is over. Having potential feelings for her himself, Jojo forges a letter from ""Nathan"" which claims that he has found someone else and wants to break up with Elsa. Jojo feels guilty seeing her cry, and writes another letter retracting the first one, and argues with Adolf when he suggests Elsa is a monster. Later, while collecting metal, Jojo spots his mother leaving a ""free Germany"" message in town. Jojo is home one day when the Gestapo, led by Captain Deertz (Stephen Merchant), visit his house. Elsa reveals herself, pretending to be his sister Inge, their suspicions seem to be subsided when she confirms her birthday from memory. But Elsa realises she recited the wrong date, and that Klenzendorf, who also happened to arrive at the house during the visit, covered for her, she is confident she will be found out. Later that day, Jojo finds his mother has been hanged in the town square. Devastated, he returns home and tries to stab Elsa, but she comforts him when he breaks down. Jojo runs into Yorki, now a soldier, who tells him Hitler has committed suicide and that the Allies are closing in. A battle rages in the town, during which Fraulein Rahm (Rebel Wilson), arming and sacrificing children, is killed in an explosion. As the American and Soviet forces arrive, several Germans are captured, including a wounded Klenzendorf, who sacrifices himself to allow a captured Jojo to escape. The soldiers expel Jojo as Klenzendorf claims he is a Jew; he runs away as shots are heard. Jojo runs home, he wants to stop Elsa from leaving, so he lies, tells her that Germany won the war. Jojo gives her a ""new"" letter from Nathan, claiming that he and Jojo have found a way to smuggle her to Paris. Elsa confesses that her boyfriend died the previous year. Jojo tells her he loves her, and she tells him she loves him in a ""little brother"" way. The imaginary Hitler confronts Jojo for siding with Elsa, and Jojo kicks him out the window. Jojo takes Elsa outside, where she realises the Allies have won after seeing American soldiers. She slaps Jojo in the face for lying, and then they dance in the street. Also starring Game of Thrones' Alfie Allen as Finkel. Griffin Davis is a fantastic new young talent, Johansson is really good in her short time onscreen, the support of Rockwell, Wilson and Merchant are also great, and Waititi almost steals the show as the immature imaginary Nazi dictator the boy talks to. This works really well, seeing the war from the point-of-view of a child who is unaware of the full magnitude of it, obviously there is serious material, including anti-Semitism and the Nazi dictatorship, but it is funny and pokes fun where it can, not for everyone, but for me an enjoyable satirical wartime comedy-drama. It won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay for Taika Waititi, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Costume Design, Best Production Design, and Best Film Editing, it won the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, Original Music for Michael Giacchino, Best Editing, Best Production Design, and Best Costume Design, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. Very good!",positive
"I'm usually quite decisive when it comes to rating films, but Jojo Rabbit has me in a bit of a quandry. I enjoyed the touching storyline of 10-year-old 'Hitler youth' Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) befriending Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie), the Jewish girl he finds hiding in his home. And I enjoyed the general irreverent tone and quirky satire. But I didn't laugh. Not once. And since I believe this is intended to be a comedy, I can't say that it is a complete success. A rating of 5 feels a little unfair, since the film is an undeniably unique and visually impressive experience, but at the same time it seems like a reasonable score for something that has left me feeling unsatisfied as a whole.I definitely wish that Roman Griffin Davis and Archie Yates (who plays Jojo's friend Yorki) hadn't filmed an introduction for the preview I attended: it made it harder to accept them as their characters, which, to be honest, wasn't that easy in the first place because neither is particularly convincing. The adults are far better, with Stephen Merchant as a nasty Gestapo officer Deertz almost making me smile, and Sam Rockwell shining as Captain Klenzendorf, a disillusioned soldier who isn't as bad as he first seems. Director Taika Waititi mercilessly mocks Adolf Hitler, who appears to Jojo as an imaginary friend - he's fun (but not funny). Scarlett Johansson is extremely likeable as Jojo's loving mother, and even Rebel Wilson, who I normally can't stand, was bearable as cruel Nazi Fraulein Rahm.5/10. I might like it more on a second viewing. Then again, I might dislike it more.",negative
"My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. Not knowing what to expect, after about 8 minutes she said ""This is all pretty silly."" And the first 10 to 15 minutes are indeed pretty silly, in effect making fun of the German Nazis and their training of their youth to be men of Hitler. And how to hate Jews.The title comes from the main character, a boy of 10 whose nickname is Jojo. As a test he is ordered to kill a rabbit with his bare hands. Not being that cruel he tried to let the rabbit go, and to run, so the older Nazi boys started calling him ""Jojo Rabbit"" as a demeaning label.The story changes tenor when Jojo hears some noise upstairs at home and being a good detective finds a teenage Jewish girl in a secret hiding place in his attic. Jojo's mother (Johanssen) has put her up so that she will avoid arrest and death. As the story develops the boy and the girl form an unlikely bond. They come to love each other as brother and sister.Frankly I'm still not sure what I think of the movie as a whole, I know it got awards and was nominated for ""Best Picture"" but being very unconventional I still don't know where I rank it. I need to watch it again before I return the DVD.",negative
"Right, well I didn't really know what I was getting myself into when I sat down to watch the 2019 movie ""Jojo Rabbit"", except for knowing it to be a comedy of sorts and that it was set during World War II.I must say that ""Jojo Rabbit"" is a very unique movie, and it was a funny approach for a movie revolving around events of World War II. This is definitely not something you'd see in other war movies. For better or worse, some might not like it, however, I happened to enjoy it quite a lot. It was a refreshing take on a matter as serious as World War II.And director and writer Taika Waititi managed to create a movie that had equal amounts of seriousness and comedy to it, in a way that really worked well in favor of the movie. To Taika Waititi's praise, I must say that this movie was enjoyable, quirky, sure, but enjoyable.The movie had wonderful props, sets and costumes, and they had a glorious cast ensemble to perform the various roles in the movie. I must say that I really enjoyed the performance of Taika Waititi in the role of Adolf Hitler, that was just brilliant and hilarious. I was surprised to see Sam Rockwell and Scarlett Johansson in a movie such as this, but they complimented the movie quite well. I think it was a shame that Rebel Wilson didn't have a larger part in the movie, because her character had so much to offer.I enjoyed ""Jojo Rabbit"" from start to end, and I can warmly recommend that you take the time to sit down and watch this odd war movie. Lots of laughs throughout the course of the movie. This is definitely well worth the money, effort and time to sit down and watch.I am rating the movie six out of ten stars.",positive
"I'm a big fan of Taika Waititi. His film What We Do In the Shadows is one that I've introduced to so many people and given to just as many as a gift. His take on Thor pretty much changed the Marvel cinematic universe for the better and is the proof of goodness I point to when people naysay superhero films. And he's also been behind some intriguing fare like Eagle vs. Shark, Boy and Hunt for the Wilderpeople, all while playing memorable roles like Korg in the Marvel films, Viago in What We Do In the Shadows and IG-11 in The Mandalorian.His take on Christine Leunens's book Caging Skies intrigued me from the first previews. While he was slated to work on a live action adaption of Akira - Hollywood won't give up on trying - this was a different movie that needed a deft hand. Luckily, Waititi was that hand.Johannes ""Jojo"" Betzler (Roman Griffin Davis in his first role) is a ten-year-old boy who is a member of Hitlerjugend, the Nazi youth movement. His father is supposedly fighting on the Italian Front, his sister has recently died and all he has left is his mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson). Oh yeah - and his best and imaginary friend, Adolph Hitler (Waititi).Jojo and his best friend Yorki attend a training camp, run by Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell, as always wonderful), who keeps failing at nearly everything. When ordered to kill a rabbit, Jojo finds that he cannot, earning the nickname Jojo Rabbit. To get back in the graces of the other young Nazis, Hitler convinces Jojo to throw a grenade without permission, which gives him facial scars and a limp.A demoted Klenzendorf is asked by Jojo's mother to include her son, so he is given the job of spreading propaganda and collecting scrap metal.Meanwhile, Rosie is hiding Jewish girl Elsa Korr (Thomasin McKenzie, Leave No Trace) in her home. The revelation that Jewish people aren't monsters, as well as the end of the war and his mother's role in being against the Nazis will change Jojo's view of the world.Notably, every Nazi in the film is comedically ineffective, from Rebel Wilson as Fraulein Rahm to Stephen Merchant as the Gestapo agent Deertz and Alfie Allen as the second-in-command Finkel. The town's stand against the Allies and Russians is well-nigh laughable, but also strangely heartbreaking. There's been some criticism that the Nazis are shown in a good light at times in this film and as comedic foils at others. To me, they're shown as objects of derision, paper villains that easily crumble when the real world intrudes. Klenzendorf sees himself as one of the heroic Aryan ideal that winds up in military finery in well-lit paintings with a Wagnerian soundtrack, but the best that he can do is spit in Jojo's face to save his life.",positive
"This film set in Nazi Germany is really quite different from the rest. It approaches the difficult and painful topic in a light hearted manner, while still maintaining respect. The ending leaves many things to the unsaid, which makes it more powerful. I enjoyed it a lot.",positive
"Now I am not a fan of children in films so approached this with more than a soupçon of trepidation. Well you can shoot me down in flames - Roman Griffin Davis is superb, simply superb. Can an 11 year old get an Oscar nomination? The story is quite surreal; a young Hitlerjugend (Nazi youth) discovers that his mother is harbouring a young Jewish girl under the eaves of their roof. What should he do? He's got Taika Waititi (aka Hitler) in his head preaching Nazi Arian philosophy at him whilst his own humanity (and curiosity) is guiding him elsewhere. Scarlett Johansson and the slightly sexually ambiguous pairing of Sam Rockwell and Alfie Allen are great at keeping the whole thing going and it's funny and inventive from start to finish. Special mentions for Archie Yates as his pal ""Yorki"" and Davis' acting coach Rachel House who has done a splendid job.",positive
"This seems to be a case of Divisive We Stand, United We Fall. If we DID need yet another satiric take on World War Two then this is as good as any and can be placed alongside Bergnini's Life Is Wonderful, Wilder's A Foreign Affair and others of the same ilk albeit different wars. Once again (Life Is Beautiful) the director takes a leading role and once again it does no harm. Kudos all round.",positive
"World War 2. Jojo is a 10-year-old German boy and a zealous follower of Hitler. He even has an imaginary friend, Adolf, who resembles Hitler and who motivates him and guides his actions. Then one day he finds a Jewish girl hiding in his house.Superb. Written and directed by Taika Waititi, who wrote and directed the excellent 'What We Do In the Shadows' plus 'Hunt For The Wilderpeople' and 'Boy' and directed 'Thor: Ragnarok'. While Waititi is more renowned as a comedic director (though many of his films have dramatic elements to them), Jojo Rabbit is a great balance between comedy and drama.Initially this combination of comedy and drama is a bit jarring, as you'll have some great comedy moments mixed in with some deadly serious, even tragic, dramatic moments. One moment you'll have an hilarious scene where the Nazis are being made fun of, the next you see the tragic effects of their regime. This two-tone approach initially makes the movie quite unsettling.However, from a point the comedy-drama divide follows a rhythm and things settle down. As the movie goes on the tone becomes more consistently serious, leading to a powerful, profound, emotional conclusion.Solid performances by Ronan Griffin Davis as Jojo, Thomasin McKenzie as Elsa and Scarlett Johansson as Jojo's mother. Waititi himself takes on the Hitler role and does a great job. Outstanding performance of the movie goes to Sam Rockwell as Captain Klenzendorf, the jaded, alcoholic German Army officer.

Wonderful and gloriously off-the-wall comedy set in Nazi Germany with newcomer Griffin Davis as a young German boy caught up with Hitler (even to the point of the Fuhrer being his imaginary friend played with gusto by filmmaker Waititi who adapted the novel by Christine Leunens, 'Caging Skies' and scoring an Oscar for Best Screenplay Adaptation in the process) while befriending a Jewish adolescent (McKenzie) conflicting with his 'beliefs' and good conscience as a human being. While outrageous and skirting black comedy and good taste the film not only satirizes the horrid horde but illustrates how repugnant hatred truly is.",positive
"So I didn't even really want to see ""Jojo Rabbit"" that much based on the reviews, the kind of movie the reviews confirmed it to be, and my past experience with Taika Waititi's style. I thought it would be another Wes Anderson rip-off, and I wasn't in the mood for another ""aren't Nazis goofy?"" comedy that tries to make light of the Holocaust by making Nazis look like buffoons (no thank you, ""Life Is Beautiful."")But the movie buff in me hates not having an opinion about movies that strike a chord with the public, and the Academy Award completist in me wasn't sure I could live with myself if I didn't see every movie nominated for Best Picture this year. So I sucked it up and bought a ticket.My 10 year old son is studying the Holocaust in school, and his class had recently gone to a Holocaust museum in the Chicago area, so I asked him if he wanted to see this movie with me. It was his first time attending a ""grown up"" movie (""Star Wars"" films aside, if those are considered to be grown up movies). He was clearly very proud to be attending a PG-13 movie with his dad, and the experience was made sweeter for him by the fact that his younger brother had to stay home (I couldn't tell from the parental advisory whether or not it would be appropriate for an 8 year old). So there I am watching a movie about a 10 year old boy sitting next to my 10 year old boy, and man did I get the feels. Everything people have criticized this movie for is true. It paints a very sanitized picture of Nazi Germany and downplays how awful it would have been to live it. The Holocaust is a vague spectre somewhere in the background, never overtly shown and never feeling like a serious threat. The message is big and obvious, the emotional manipulation rampant.But what the hell. I kind of fell in love with this movie because of who I was seeing it with, and I loved that it was about learning to differentiate between the world as certain people (relatives, the media, our government, you name it) want you to perceive it and the world as you actually experience it. Yes, I knew my heartstrings were being tugged, and me in a different mood would have had none of it. But me in the mood I was in was all ""oh, let my heartstrings be tugged.""I also have never picked a worse time to go to the bathroom during a movie in my entire movie watching career. I can't go into details without throwing in a major spoiler, but let's just say my son had to tell me what happened when I got back and I had to wonder if my absence during that critical moment would traumatize my son forever. But he was fine.Grade: A",positive
"Greetings again from the darkness. Welcome to the most divisive movie of the year. Some will scoff at the idea and deride the filmmaker without ever even seeing the movie. Some will relay disgust after seeing the movie. A few won't appreciate the style or structure, and will fail to find the humor. Ah yes, but some of us will embrace Taika Waititi's wacky adaptation of Christine Leunens' 2018 novel ""Caging Skies"" as one of the funniest and most heart-warming films of the year ... fully acknowledging that many won't see it our way.One wouldn't be off base in asking why a successful filmmaker would tackle such a risky project: a coming-of-age comedy-drama-fantasy about a 10 year old Nazi fanatic who has as his imaginary friend, not a 6 foot rabbit, but the Fuhrer himself, Adolph Hitler. After all, writer-director Waititi is coming off a couple of brilliant indies (2014's WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS, and 2016's HUNT FOR THE WILDERPEOPLE) and a major score with Marvel money on THOR: RAGNAROK (2017), arguably the most entertaining superhero movie of the past few years. He certainly could have continued to cash in with 'safer' choices; however, Mr. Waititi sees the world differently than most of us. He finds humor in the drudgery, and humanity in malevolence. He's also a bit goofy.Playing over the opening credits is the German version of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", as we see old clips of German citizens cheering for Adolph Hitler in a similar manner to how fans used to scream for The Beatles. World War II is nearing the end as we meet 10 year old Jojo Betzler (newcomer Roman Griffin Davis). Jojo is fervent in his fanaticism towards the Nazi way, and buys into the belief that Jews are monsters with horns on their head. He's such a believer that his imaginary friend is actually Hitler, well at least a bumbling boisterous version played by the filmmaker himself - enacted to extreme comedy effect (recalling a bit of Chaplin in THE GREAT DICTATOR). Mel Brooks managed to play Hitler to a laughable extreme in ""Springtime for Hitler"" in THE PRODUCERS, but the only thing missing her from Waititi's costume is an old timey dunce cap.Jojo lives at home with his mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson), while dad is off fighting on the front line. Ms. Johansson's performance is terrific (despite limited screen time) as she creates a believably warm bond with her son during horrific times. Soon, Jojo is off to a Nazi camp designed to teach the boys how to fight (and burn books), as the girls learn the virtues of having babies. The camp leaders are Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell), who is a bit of a joke on the surface, but more interesting the deeper we dig; Fraulein Rahm (Rebel Wilson) who boasts of having 18 Aryan babies; and Finkel (Alfie Allen) a violent psychopath. At camp with Jojo is his best friend Yorki (newcomer and scene-stealer Archie Yates), and the two show what a genuine friendship can be as the movie progresses.Things change quickly for Jojo when, by happenstance, he discovers a Jewish girl living in the walls of his home. Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie, LEAVE NO TRACE) shows none of the characteristics that Jojo has been brainwashed into believing all Jews possess. She has no horns, flashes a good sense of humor, and is actually very nice and knowledgeable. In other words, she's no monster. As they get to know each other, Jojo realizes this ""nice"" Jewish girl contrasts starkly with his lunatic hero Adolph.Waititi's film is ingenious satire, and it likely won't sit well with those who think not enough time has passed to justify making fun of Nazi atrocities. It's funny and heavy, and deals with some thought-provoking matter in an unusual way. The ""Heil Hitler"" count approaches the 'F-word' frequency of most Tarantino movies, and there is a German Shepherd gag that caught the audience off-guard. Stephen Merchant's Gestapo search of Jojo's house is comedy at its weirdest. The movie messes with your head as it's some odd blend of SCHINDLER'S LIST, ""The Diary of Anne Frank"", and an extended Monty Python skit.It's rare for a film that borders on slapstick at times to have so many touching and emotional moments. The actors are really strong here, especially Ms. Johansson and Ms. McKenzie, who as gutsy Elsa, proves again she is quickly becoming a powerhouse young actor. Roman Griffin Davis carries a significant weight in the story despite being a first time actor, and I can't emphasize enough how young Archie Yates will steal your heart while he's stealing his scenes. Michael Giacchino's score and Mihai Malaimaire Jr's terrific cinematography work well with Waititi's vision ... a satirical vision that would never work outside of his unique filmmaking talent. The story is basically proof of the adage, 'Kill 'em with kindness', when what we are really killing is hatred. At its core, this is a story of humanity and human nature, and how we grab hold of the wrong thing until the truth becomes evident. Now, please pass the unicorn.",positive
"I went to see this new Star Wars movie tonight--a few weeks after it opened to tepid reviews. Well, after seeing it I can understand some of the lack of enthusiasm for ""The Rise of Skywalker"", as it suffers from a HUGE problem...I felt pretty much indifferent to it. I would have preferred it if the movie has really sucked...then I would have had fun laughing at it.I won't recount the plot here...mostly because the film was non-stop and most plot elements lasted mere minutes. The folks went from one deadly fight to another to another to another...and much of the first portion of the film turned out to be unnecessary.I am NOT a 'Comicbook Guy' who complains that the film isn't true to the original three or other such nonsense. I have gone to all the films and enjoyed them (with the exception of ""Episode 3""...but few enjoyed that movie)...and I really enjoyed some of the more recent ones. But I disliked much of ""Episode IX"" because it seems like J.J. Abrams is trying to undo so much of what Rian Johnson did in ""Episode VIII"". Sad...but I liked ""Episode VIII"". Instead of relationships and characters, ""Episode IX"" is pretty much only about explosions, near misses and more explosions....as well as long dead characters suddenly coming back to life for no good reason.All in all, a joyless mass of explosions and a film I should have just skipped. The theater also was showing ""Knives Out"" (By Johnson) and that film was FUN. ""Star Wars: Episode IX"" is simply un-fun.",negative
"Saw 'The Rise of Skywalker' just before Christmas with my sister, but it took me a while to gather my thoughts on it. Being not sure what rating to give it or how to express my opinion on the film. Will admit that when seeing it in the cinema, to me it was enjoyable but had a lot of faults. Since watching 'The Rise of Skywalker' then though, the more it has been thought about the more it has gone down in my estimations. My reservations felt back then still remain the same, as well as what struck me was good, while thinking of more since.My opinions on the previous 'Stars Wars' films were much more definite, being a fan of the original trilogy and while the prequel trilogy had a lot of flaws to me they weren't that bad. Also thought 'The Force Awakens' and 'The Last Jedi' were better than expected (am aware that possible blasphemy has been committed here), but 'The Last Jedi' certainly had a lot wrong with it. 'Solo' was good fun on its own terms too. Absolutely judging it from an open mind, 'The Rise of Skywalker' left me very conflicted however and ended the trilogy on a whimper rather than a bang, it's not deserving of a 1/10 but it is not near deserving in my opinions of the 10/10s mostly given to counter the negativity in classic critic bashing style. Of the franchise, this was the one in all honesty that left me the most disappointed.Will start with the good things with 'The Rise of Skywalker'. It is gorgeously shot and designed and the special effects are often a marvel. John Williams delivers yet another rousing score that has its own character but cleverly includes the well-known iconic themes from the previous films.There are some great performances here, Daisy Ridley carries the film outstandingly, having become more confident with each film, and Adam Driver is menacing and conflicted. Carrie Fisher again brings nostalgic poignancy to Leia, while John Boyega and Oscar Isaac are charismatic and do their best with what they were given (which was quite weak in my view) and how great it was to see Ian McDiarmid again as Palpatine, again his material was not great but he does a good job with it. Chewbacca is as adorable and funny as ever and C-3PO provided a few amusing moments. Babu Frik was a nice new addition and there were a couple of touching and nostalgic moments. Some of the action is thrilling, namely the extended blaster battle and Rey and Kylo's force-based clash.For all those good things, 'The Rise of Skywalker' has a lot of major flaws. With so little time to breathe in the story, the film feels far too rushed which made it very difficult to digest the more convoluted parts of the story. There is also too much going on so the film feels very cramped by the final act, and also too many characters. Some are fun but too many of them are underused or even pointless and tacked on, such as Lando and Rose Tico. Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford only seemed to be there for nostalgia purposes and are merely walk-ons.Although the action has its moments, too much of it doesn't rouse like it should do and is in a way forgettable. The big reveal that has been much discussed here made absolutely no sense (the atmosphere felt at that part in the packed auditorium in the cinema was like a uniform ""what the heck?"") and really convoluted the storytelling later on, leading to a conclusion that felt rather too anti-climactic and made a waste of the characters involved in it. A long way from a bang. Morever, the dialogue is as bad and even downright laughable than the worst of the prequel trilogy's with far too much exposition and unrealistic conveniences.Overall, have seen far worse but a big disappointment. If some people liked it, good for you. It just didn't work for me and many others, for reasons that are valid, and it is inexplicable as to why people have an inability to accept that, and not just for this film but for almost every film here. 5/10",negative
"The Empire is in chaos. There is a pretender on the throne. A new rebellion is banished to the Outer Rim. The Empire is re-establishing control with yet another Order. At least, it's not another Death Star. It's Disney Plus spaceships with guns. The Mouse Empire muddles on. The new trilogy is simply not planned out. That is its major flaw above all else. This final chapter tries to take back a few story elements and wrap up the story with a bow. It is not to be dissected for plot holes or logic flaws. It rushes to push the franchise across the finish line. It works to some extend and it doesn't cause any more major troubles. Most fans would probably be satisfied with reaching the finish line and not having any more movies for awhile.Nobody is a somebody. A shocking reveal happens and it barely clears the bar. There are plenty of problems and an Orphan Black situation. Like many elements in this movie, one should not think too hard about it. Remember Tom Cruise's War of the Worlds. This one does something even crazier with its spaceships. This is the stupidest part of the plot but let's roll our eyes and move on. The plot is basically getting the MacGuffin to get another MacGuffin. The film is running on double time and the speed seems to be used to hide from story questions. Everybody is rushing. History is being revised. No one is throwing away a light saber in this one. Finn never actually say the thing to Rey. It is emotionally safe. I thought they would keep Carrie Fisher in the first act but they dragged her out there for too long. I won't say that it's disrespectful but it is a little awkward. Overall, this one tries to quickly wrap up the story in a fan friendly way and the last person turns out the lights.",negative
"I thought the The Rise of Skywalker made a fitting end of Disney's Star Wars trilogy. It marks the end of the original characters, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Han Solo.It also deals with Rey's story and that of Kylo Ren. Destiny and redemption.The evil empire is not quite finished nor are the Sith. Kylo Ren aims to mimic his grandfather and discovers that Palpatine was always in control.Rey and the rebels search for the planet where Palpatine is hiding. It will bring Rey into conflict with Kylo Ren and she will find her true heritage.Although 20 minutes too long, this one is aimed at fans. Well fans who do not use terms like 'Mary Sue' or 'Woke.' Just imagine if there were internet forums back in 1980 when The Empire Strikes Back was released. Hold on what's a black man doing there?There are nods to the past, Lando Calrissian returns, Wedge Antilles flies by. You can even spot Ewoks.There were also poignant moments, Chewbacca's reaction to the death of Leia was rather emotional. Knowing this is likely to be the last time we shall see Hamill and Ford in a Star Wars movie. I am sure there would be more Star Wars movies in the future but this is an end of an era.",positive
"It has been quite some time since I got excited about this franchise; I guess the TV shows maybe are doing more at the minute, but for the films there is little to get excited about within them, and probably far too many of them being made for all the 'proper' fan to make it a date. Rise of Skywalker had been largely panned by viewers and critics, but I decided it was a good Friday night sort of film - one that doesn't take too much effort to watch. I was correct because this film really doesn't have much of a plot to care about, and seems to have been patched together without a lot of thought to the whole.Technically it is very impressive - although of course it is because hundreds of millions of pounds were spent to make it sound and look good; and it mostly does. If you want lightsabers and space battles then you get it here. However if you put aside the technical feat, it is very much hollow. I struggled to care about anyone in the film; the dialogue was often clunky, and there was almost nothing natural or organic in there. The writing doesn't help itself by doing things that seem fan-service at best, and cynical at worst. For example the constant references back to other films by having scenes that echo scenes in the original films break things up. Meanwhile moments or aspects are included that don't seem to mean much in the moment and feel like they have been included in the hope of linking to yet another spinoff opportunity. With all this, the cast are mostly stuck with just going with it the best they can but nobody really stands out as an actor.In the end, it is a fairly bland product; full of noise and spectacle but nothing of any real grit, interest, or substance.",negative
"The battle continues. We discover Rey's heritage and I admit I was wrong about Obi-Wan. We quickly find out the Emperor and Ian McDiarmid are still alive and control little Darth as they go on planet destruction. Past characters are brought into the feature, both living and dead. Thank you for not reviving Jar Jar Binks. There is plenty of action and Rey is seemingly placed in a no-win situation. Billy Dee Williams makes a surprise return, as does Mr. Ford.There were unexpected things, but when they did happen it felt cliche and expected. I liked the campfire ending in episode 6 better than this one. Disney leaves open a possible sequel 20 years from now when Rey has twins, one good and one evil. Yes, worth watching on the large screen, but what Star Wars wasn't? Okay, there were a few.",positive
"I know that many have waited for this. And I can tell you they were way more excited than I was. I have watched the Star Wars movies and I am not as big a fan as many of them are. I don't dislike the movies or the franchise. I just never was as big a fan as many were. One of the reasons is, I never had the experience as a kid. So while I totally get what some feel about them, and I respect that, I hope the same is attributed to me and my views.Having said all that, the movie is what one should and could expect. With some twists that may not make much sense, but get the thing to the intended ending everyone was ... well at list wishing for. Not exactly as it happens here of course, but still. You can't make everyone happy, that is just not possible. So this is either religion for you or just plain fun for a couple of hours. The director tried his best to please as many people as possible, which might not be necessarily a good thing ... but there you go",negative
"Much like the episodes 'The Force Awakens' and 'The Last Jedi', I'm left with sort of a ho-hum feeling about this last picture in the Star Wars franchise. It's certainly got it's share of now familiar characters and monumental action scenes, but somehow it didn't seem enough. It felt like the film makers tried to cram in as much story as possible into the picture, but in so doing gave us some confusing scenarios that don't gel very well with the past. The return of Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) is one example, and that was a pretty major one. Internal consistency is also a problem, when someone like Rey (Daisy Ridley) can maintain an epic power struggle with Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) over the escaping air ship, but then has to exert herself climbing a rock face later in the picture. Why rely on human strength when you have all this mystical ability at your command? I did like the nods to the original players in the Star Wars saga, as the writers found a way to bring back Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa and Lando Calrissian. That was essentially a given knowing that the nine part series had now reached it's finale, and that sort of tribute was well deserved. As one who's been around as long as the franchise, I'm pretty much happy and satisfied that the story has run it's course fulfilling George Lucas's original mission. But if you want the real magic you have to go back to 'A New Hope' and relive how it all began.",positive
"The apparent end of the Star Wars franchise was what I expected. I don't see how they would expand the franchise beyond here, and I hope that they don't. Carrie Fisher deserves to rest in peace.Although I gotta admit that it was interesting looking at the cast and noticing that it includes Lin-Manuel Miranda as well as George Harrison's son Dhani.",negative
"Disney acquiring Lucasfilm was a great decision, the first of the new space saga sequel movies The Force Awakens was brilliant, and the second film The Last Jedi was also fantastic, and after 42 years since the release of the original Star Wars, this was the final film of the franchise, directed by J. J. Abrams (Lost, Mission: Impossible III, Star Trek, Super 8). Basically, a threat of revenge has been received from Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), assumed to be dead years ago. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), having obtained a Sith wayfinder device on the planet Mustafar, finds the Emperor on the uncharted planet Exegol. The Emperor reveals that he created Snoke as a puppet to control the First Order and lure Kylo to the Dark Side. Palpatine then releases a secret fleet of Star Destroyers and tells Kylo to find and kill Rey (Daisy Ridley), who is continuing her Jedi training, with the help of Resistance leader General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher). A spy within the First Order has delivered information, which Finn (John Boyega) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) say reveals Palpatine's location on Exegol. Rey meanwhile learns from notes left by Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) about a Sith wayfinder can lead them there. Rey, Finn, Poe, Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo), BB-8, and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) depart in the Millennium Falcon for the planet Pasana to find an ally as recommended by Leia. There, they find Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), who points them in the direction of the wayfinder's last suspected location. Kylo learns where Rey is through their Force bond and travels there with his warrior subordinates, the Knights of Ren. Rey and the others discover the remains of the assassin Ochi of Bestoon (Liam Cook), his ship and droid, and a dagger inscribed with Sith text, which C-3PO's programming forbids him from translating. The First Order captures the Falcon, Chewbacca, and the dagger. Rey tries to save Chewbacca, but accidentally destroys a First Order transport with Force lightning. The group escape in Ochi's ship, assuming that Chewbacca is dead. Poe suggests traveling to Kijimi to have the Sith text extracted from C-3PO's memory. C-3Po's memory is wiped in the process, but coordinates reveal that a wayfinder is on Kef Bir. Rey senses that Chewbacca is alive, and the group mounts a rescue mission. While Kylo searches for Rey, the group infiltrates his Star Destroyer with the help of Zorii Bliss (Keri Russell), an old acquaintance of Poe's. Rey recovers the dagger and has visions of her mother (Jodie Comer) and father (Billy Howle) being killed with it. Kylo informs her that she is Palpatine's granddaughter; he reveals that Ochi was ordered by the Sith lord to recover Rey as a child, but she was hidden by her parents for her protection on Jakku. General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) saves Poe, Finn, and Chewbacca from execution, revealing himself to be the spy. He lets them escape on the Falcon but is executed by General Pryde (Richard E. Grant) for treason. The group arrives on Kef Bir. Resistance sympathiser Jannah (Naomi Ackie) leads them to the remains of the second Death Star, where the wayfinder is located. Finn is surprised to find out that, like himself, Jannah is also a former stormtrooper, and was one of many deserters. Kylo tracks them down, destroys Rey's wayfinder and asks her to join him to go against Palpatine. Leia is dying, before passing away she calls to Kylo through the Force, distracting him as he duels with Rey, who impales him. Sensing Leia's death, Rey heals Kylo using the Force and takes his ship. She returns to Ahch-To, where the Force spirit of Luke encourages Rey to face Palpatine and gives her Leia's lightsaber. Rey uses the wayfinder in Kylo's ship to make her way to Exegol. After healing, Kylo talks to the spirit of his father, Han Solo (Harrison Ford), after which he throws away his lightsaber and reclaims his identity as Ben Solo. The Resistance then see the planet Kijimi obliterated by a Star Destroyer equipped with a super laser. At the Resistance base, R2-D2 (Hassan Taj and Lee Towersey) restores C-3PO's memory upon the group's return. The Resistance follows Rey's coordinates to Exegol, where she confronts Palpatine. The Emperor wants her to kill him, being his relative he wants to transfer his spirit into her body. Lando brings reinforcements from across the galaxy to join the battle against Palapatine's army, the Last Order. Ben overpowers the Knights of Ren and joins Rey. Palpatine drains the pair's power to rejuvenate himself. He attacks the Resistance fleet with Force lightning and incapacitates Ben. Rey is weakened, she hears the voices of past Jedi, who lend her their strength. Ben revives Rey by transferring his life force into her; they kiss and Ben dies, becoming one with the Force, along with the body of his mother Leia. The remainder of Palpatine's armada are successful destroyed by the Resistance. As the Resistance celebrates, Rey visits the abandoned home of Luke Skywalker on Tatooine. She buries the Skywalker lightsabers, having built her own. A passerby asks her name; she replies, ""Rey Skywalker"". Also starring Kelly Marie Tran as Rose Tico, composer John Williams as Oma Tres and Mary Poppins Returns' Lin-Manuel Miranda as a Soldier, with the voices of James Earl Jones as Darth Vader, Andy Serkis as Snoke, Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker, Samuel L. Jackson as Mace Windu, Ewan McGregor as the younger Obi Wan Kenobi, Sir Alec Guinness as the older Obi Wan Kenobi, Frank Oz as Yoda, Freddie Prinze Jr. As Kannan Jarus and Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn. The appearances of Hamill, Ford and Fisher (through unused footage from The Force Awakens) are good, Boyega and Isaac are great as the heroes, and McDiarmid returning as the sinister Emperor is welcome, but I agree with critics that this film pretty much belongs to Ridley and Driver, delivering the key moments that will bring the show to a close. I will be honest and say that this finale to the saga is almost the same quality as Return of the Jedi, very enjoyable, but just that tiny something missing, perhaps it is lacking a little emotionally. However, you cannot ignore the spectacular battle sequences, the brilliant special effects and the well-paced action, all together it is a terrific worthwhile science-fiction fantasy action adventure. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Original Score for John Williams, Best Visual Effects, and Best Sound Editing, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Original Music, Best Sound, and Best Special Visual Effects. Star Wars was number 24 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!",positive
"As this, the ninth and final chapter in the Skywalker Saga opens Kylo Ren makes his way to the planet Exegol where he finds Emperor Palpatine. He is ordered to find and kill Rey. Meanwhile a spy aboard the First Order fleet passes on a message warning that the Emperor is back and is will destroy any world that doesn't surrender. Rey, Finn, Poe Dameron and others must find a way to get to Exegol and stop the Emperor before it is too late. Inevitably this won't be easy and they will have to visit new worlds, face threats both new and old and make new friends.When I first watched 'Star Wars' it was in the cinema when I was ten years old in 1977 and I, like all my friends, was awestruck. All these years later I may not be quite as awestruck watching this on DVD but I still really enjoyed it. The story provides lots of excitement and characters I care about; some like Rey and Finn first appeared in this trilogy, others like Leah and Luke have been there from the start. I wasn't expecting any real surprises but one was delivered... which I won't spoil here. There were also some genuinely emotional moments. The cast does a fine job; I particularly liked Daisy Ridley's performance as Rey. It was a treat to see many of the cast of the original films returning; it was especially poignant to see Carrie Fisher's final performance. As one would expect the special effects were top notch. I know a lot of people were disappointed but I really liked it and would say it is a must see for Star Wars fans... love it or loathe it; decide for yourself.",positive
"After the debacle that was The Last Jedi, I (and many other lifelong Star Wars fans) had hoped that lessons would have been learned at the House of Mouse, and that the final film in Lucas's proposed nine-movie saga would end the franchise on a high. Sadly, this is not the case.J.J. Abrams, who also directed the fair-to-middling Episode VI: The Force Awakens, gives us another visually impressive movie full of breathtaking worlds and amazing creatures, but his film suffers from a mediocre plot full of elements that make very little sense and which will annoy the hell out of Star Wars purists.The basic storyline sees Rey (Daisy Ridley) and her rebel pals trying to find where the evil First Order are gathering their forces, so they can launch a final assault and end the tyranny of Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) once and for all. Along the way, Chewie (now played by Joonas Suotamo) is taken hostage, C3-PO (Anthony Daniels) gets his memory wiped, and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) realises that, hey, perhaps being bad isn't for him after all.The whole thing rushes clumsily from one scenario to another with little care for logic, the makers clearly hoping that the dazzling on-screen spectacle will distract the viewer from the fact that nothing here is all that original, and that the narrative is choppy and often confusing, with many contrived moments that are there purely to further the plot, or to retroactively explain away mistakes in the previous movies.My biggest gripe is the scene in which Rey crosses a stormy sea (very impressive digital effects) to the wreckage of the death star. That's right... either the same death star that was blown into a gazillion atoms by Luke Skwalker in A New Hope (or perhaps the second one in ROTJ, also obliterated). Somehow, this massive chunk of debris crashed onto a planet and just happens to hold the artefact required to guide the rebels to the enemy. Talk about convenient. The most pointless scene is an Androcles-inspired encounter with a subterranean serpent. And the most blatant act of back-pedalling comes in a short scene that shows Leia training as a Jedi, so as to excuse her sudden 'space flying' ability in The Last Jedi.Of the bits that actually work, a chase scene involving our heroes on speeders and stormtroopers on caterpillar-tread bikes is exhilarating, a Pasaana festival (celebrated every 42 years! Geddit?) features some wonderful dancing Cthulu-like aliens, there's a cute Anzellan droidsmith called Babu Frik who guarantees a few giggles, Richard E. Grant makes for a nice new villain, and the physical psychic connection between Ren and Rey adds a new twist to the power of the force.Unfortunately, as someone who has been there from the start (I was 9 when Star Wars came out in '77), I cannot help but find Episode IX a disappointment. It's not quite as bad as The Last Jedi or Attack of the Clones (both 3/10 from me), but it's not the rousing finale that we have all been waiting for. Average just isn't good enough.",negative
"As happens often these days I am amazed and puzzled by the occasional very negative review of this movie. It is the tail, it seeks to wrap up 40+ years of stories about the particular fictional universe that is George Lucas' Star Wars. With 8 movies done this 9th one can't be very inventive, it contains most of what we Star Wars fans have already been exposed to. Harrison Ford makes a cameo appearance. Old footage is re-purposed to include Carrie Fisher. Plus her daughter, who wasn't even born until 9 years after ""Return of the Jedi"", has a small role. And Mark Hamill is there too.Some reviews criticize Daisy Ridley who as Rey is a Jedi in the mold of Luke Skywalker. She is a lovely actress and she does very well in the role, I can't say who might have been better.In my old review of the first movie, which later became known as Episode IV - A New Hope, I wrote ""'Star Wars' filled our imaginations like no other movie before it. The fantastic, strange worlds were presented almost like we were there too. Aliens sitting around a tavern, enjoying drinks and speaking in all sorts of languages. Nothing before had approached the sheer size of the space ships depicted here, huge cities traveling all over the galaxy. And how about the jump to hyper speed, then disappearing from the screen as the speed exceeds light speed! And the lightsabers of the Jedi Knights. The Jedi Knights, a striking parallel to the Japanese Samurai.""That pretty well sums up why these fictional movies have a special place in cinema history. My wife and I enjoyed this one at home on BluRay from our public library. While it can't stand up to the original trilogy it still is a nicely entertaining movie.",positive
"Right, well I am an avid fan of ""Star Wars"", and have been ever since I was introduced to ""Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope"" back in the 1980s some time. And yes, the expectations were great for this movie to bring to closure the Skywalker saga.While I am by no means a particular fan of director J.J. Abrams and his lense flares, then this movie was one that needed to be seen in the cinema. It is a ""Star Wars"" movie after all. And yeah, it definitely got a lot of grief from the elitist former ""Star Wars"" fans that were angered by their fandom not being served in the manner they wanted and expected with the previous movies. But still, to me, those fanboys' opinions hardly matter. If you dislike something, leave it alone and move along - this isn't the movie you're looking for!With pretty high expectations I went to watch ""Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker"" and I must admit that when I left the cinema, it was with a very overwhelming sense of a proper closure to this part of the ""Star Wars"" saga. This movie definitely worked for me, and it brought together a lot of ends and managed to wrap it up quite nicely in a manner that was more than satisfactory to me.""Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker"" definitely feels and looks like a ""Star Wars"" movie should, from start to end. Lots of action, character driven story and lots of attention to the ""Star Wars"" galaxy in greater and smaller detail.I am not going to delve into the storyline, but I was impressed and I was entertained. Boy, how I was entertained. There were a lot of grand moments throughout the course of this last chapter in the Skywalker saga. The return of some iconic heroes and villains, which definitely worked out so well for me and it was a nice way of wrapping things up with these characters.It should be said that the movie had me dangerously close to shedding a tear two or three times, because of my affection for the ""Star Wars"" universe and the connection that there is to the characters that I grew up with, admiring, wanting to be, playing with by the Kenner action figures, and so forth.Of the last three chapters in the Skywalker saga, then ""Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker"" is miles ahead of parts VII and VIII, both in terms of story, action and entertainment.I am rating ""Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker"" a solid nine out of ten stars, as this is very close to being as good as the original trilogy - that being parts IV, V and VI. This is well worth taking the time to sit down and watch, more than once even. Watch it for the story the first time, then watch it for all the little details and such the next time.",positive
"Three movies in to the final part of what is being called the Skywalker Saga and I have to confess: worse than not knowing anything about these new characters -- Poe Dameron, Finn and Rey -- I honestly don't care about them. They're ciphers that we only know the barest of things about. Why does Finn have such an affinity for his friends? Why should we care a lick about Poe when he's proven to be too headstrong and willing to leave people behind, yet has nothing redeeming to make up for it? And Rey has every single skill of the Jedi near-instantly, almost a way too perfect character to be true.Don't tell me I have to read the other books or watch the shows or do my research. Don't tell me that the old films in the Star Wars saga didn't come out as often or perhaps we cared too much about them. I sat -- well, slept, I'll be perfectly honest -- through this too loud and too much installment and I have to tell you my most honest review: Yeah, alright.I don't go to blockbusters to walk away saying, ""Yeah, alright.""SPOILER WARNINGObviously, everything after this will contain massive spoilers. You have been warned.The first critical error the film makes is by telling us that a secret message has caused a stir in the galaxy: the Emperor is alive. You know, instead of a scroll, perhaps this event -- probably the most important thing that's happened in all three of these post Return of the Jedi films, could have been shown to us so we could grasp just how mindblowing it is. Nope. It's in words on the screen. The dead speak! This is lazy filmmaking.Kylo Ren (Adam Driver, who isn't howling in a bar or eating ass in this one) obtains a Sith Wayfinder device and travels to the planet Exegol, where the Emperor is recharging. It turns out that everything evil in the past few films has come from Palpatine, including Snoke who is just a clone. Snoke is the most infuriating character in these films, another character who really has no motivation and no reason to exist other than being yet another Star Wars villain set up to be an undefeatable villain only to, you know, by cut in half. See: Darth Maul, General Grievous, Count Dooku.So the Emperor does what has never been done before. He just plain conjures up a million or so Star Destroyers on a planet that has constant darkness and lightning. He tells Kylo to find Rey, who is studying to be a Jedi with General Leia Organa Solo (Carrie Fisher), who is more Force-sensitive than a Jedi, you know, until this movie, which has a CGI cut scene that looks like, well, a video game cut scene that shows her training with Luke and realizing that she's going to die and not complete her journey but someone else will. Because man, Star Wars is kind of like Catholicism for people who'd rather have Carlos Casteneda instead of John the Baptist.There's also a spy in the First Order, a subplot that changes nothing in the film other than to remind you that General Hux and Ben Solo probably had a tempestuous affair at one point and there's a thin line between love and hate.Rey, Poe, Finn, Chewbacca, BB-8 and C-3PO head out for Passanna to meet Lando Calrissian while R2-D2 stays with Leia in a military base. Soon, Kylo Ben Solo and the Knights of Ren show up just as Rey discovers a Sith dagger than C-3PO's programming forbids him to read. Why? Is it because he was built by Anakin Skywalker? Nah -- it's just another dangling ""We're going to kill off another beloved character"" tease and even when they wipe out the golden droid's memory, it comes back so quickly and easily, you wonder why they even teased this moment of sadness.I also have no idea why the Knights of Ren are important other than they will make cool looking toys and fat dudes will dress like them and bump into me at conventions.Speaking of teasing the death of a major character -- Rey uses Force Lightning to accidentally kill Chewbacca, who died way back in the book Vector Prime before the books were no longer part of the real Universe. But yeah, Chewbacca survives anyway. Seriously, they should have called this movie Star Wars: Let's with Chewbacca. The dude gets tortured, stripped, Rey uses his gun, one of his best friends dies and oh yeah, he had to be in this movie.Zorii Bliss (Keri Russell, who did Alias with J.J. Abrams) is in this too. She's a masked smuggler who had something of a relationship at one point with Poe but they never kissed, which is pretty much par for Star Wars romance. She is not Zam Wesell, so don't get that confused. Honestly, her scene about wanting to leave behind the planet Kijimi is about as emotionally resonant as this movie gets.Turns out that Chewbacca is still alive, so there's a failed rescue mission on a Star Destroyer that leads to a nice scene where Rey and Kylo have a lightsaber battle between their two worlds. That's when we learn that Rey is Palpatine's granddaughter, who tried to King Herrod her as a child, as he feared her power.So hey, why don't we go back to Endor. Do we have to? Yes, we do. That's where we meet a whole bunch of other Stormtroopers who got tired of missing every shot and took off their suits and became dudes who ride yaks. Their leader, Jannah, is not Enfys Nest from Solo: A Star Wars Story, despite similar animal mounts and markings. She and Finn quickly become friends but there's not even a hint of romance.Also: remember when Rose Tico was such a big deal in the last movie? Yeah, neither do the filmmakers.There's a cool scene where the second Death Star is in the giant black waves of Endor and Kylo and Rey have another lightsaber battle. Remember when lightsaber battles were rad and you couldn't wait for them, way back before Yoda zipped all around doing backflips and suddenly, you wondered how and why lightsabers could be boring? Yeah.Man, anyways, Leia dies reaching out through the Force to her son, who gets impaled by Rey but then healed by her before she runs to the Emperor's world to kill the old man, because you know, that's what he wants. He came back from the dead so the child he sent away because he feared she would kill him can kill him. Motivations are super important in Star Wars.Nearly everyone who Hasbro will sell to idiots like me dies. Star Wars has a fetish for hands getting chopped off, British accents, wipe transitions and killing off fat spaceship pilots.Luckily, Rey and Kylo fight back, but then we learn another motivation for the Emperor: he wanted to leech their youth and become strong again. So, if Rey had just killed him, did this second plan even matter? Well, he's every Sith and Rey ends up being every Jedi and they battle and she ends up killing him. However, because she turns his Force lightning against him, she isn't killing him like he wanted and this killing is OK because Star Wars.We end up back on Tatooine where Rey goes to hide the last two lightsabers and claim the name of Skywalker. Then we see Leia looking like the Virgin Mary and Luke looking like some dude who'd go to a comic convention to meet Mark Hamill as ghosts.Question: Remember when it was a big deal that Qui-Gon Jinn didn't turn into a Force spirit and disappear and we were gonna get answers on that one? Yeah. Well, both Leia -- not a Jedi -- and Kylo Ben Solo disappear when they die. Of course, he kisses Rey first. And his dad shows up and calls back the ""I know"" line because this movie is fan service from frame one, bringing back holo chess when it's not sledgehammering plot points and deus ex machina into your feeble brainstem.This movie is a lot like sugary cereal. Sugary cereal is real good, except for how you feel sick after eating multiple bowls.Also: I kind of hate that new green robot D-O who literally talks like a Donald Trump tweet, saying ""Sad!"" when a scene is upsetting. We get it. We know it's sad. You don't have to tell us.The movie also feels like one that should pause and flash: CHECK THIS OUT! Like the tie-fighter parked next to an x-wing. We get it. We get the symbolism. Or when Wedge Antilles shows up, that kind of stuff is only for dudes like me that knew the names and call signs of every pilot. And yes, Wedge is Red Two. I was also a virgin until well into my twenties, thank you very much.So what did I like about the movie? I dug those yak creatures that they rode on the deck of the Star Destroyers and yes, I know they're called orbaks but I'm going to keep on calling them yaks. And I adored Lando basically picking up Jannah and saying, ""Let's find out where you're from."" You know he's making her crosseyed in the back of the Millennium Falcon right now while Nien Nunb wonders why there's a sock on the door. I also liked the little dude named Babu Frik who wiped out C-3PO's mind. And I kinda dug the kintsugi look of Kylo Ren's new mask.Yeah, it was also nice that we saw the first same sex kiss in Star Wars between Commander D'acy and an unnamed character that will surely get a name and a Hasbro San Diego Comic-Con two-pack release that will sell for many times the original price on eBay.Look -- I'm not going to tell you what to like and be a gatekeeper. Love what you love, enjoy what you enjoy and spend your money where you want. That said, I spent a good chunk of my life loving Star Wars and know more about Dengar than many of the extended family members. I know -- and care -- next to nothing about anything in this film. There are people who are going to go see it a few hundred times and get the sugar rush that this film is and love it because it's Star Wars. Again, being a fan of the saga is a lot like being Catholic -- you know the motions, you go through them but after a while, you question why you just don't feel the same after Mass.",positive
"After 'The last Jedi' divided fans (understatement?) it was up to JJ Abrams to return to guide not only this modern trilogy but also the 'Skywalker Saga' (Eps 1-9) to their conclusion.With so much to do it was a huge task he faced, but on the whole he does a decent job, picking and choosing bits from the 'Last Jedi' to take forward, while also paying a lot of lip service to fans whilst bringing down the curtain.Old favourites have their moments, there's twists and turns galore (some work, some don't) but on the whole this is a decent finale.",positive
"Reflective EngagementI normally write about folding; the most obvious is when a film contains a film or play, but there are a bewildering number of types. The most interesting of these to me is when the film 'folds' the watcher in, in some way. The least interesting is when a film overtly quotes another. Tarantino, does this in a way that I think distracts from his other strengths.But what happens when you have a series that is older than most people on the planet, and has a world in some way adopted by nearly everyone that folds simple myths into itself?Some of the novel folding Abrams used is required because the original three were never about a world but a story. That world was borrowed from westerns, minimally to support the story, and adapted also minimally to allow the tech. When you don't have a full world to work with, you can't expand the story into it. This world is sparse; if evil exists, it can only exist in and be opposed in one form. So, Abrams has to expand back into the story rather than into the world. He does it partly by direct quoting, adopting the key themes: parents, magical force as military force, and conflict as spatial engagement.I particularly like how he places some action in the ruins of previous movies. In episode 7, we had the star destroyer. Here we've upped the ante with the ruined death star in ultra-dynamic water.But I am going to suggest here that some of what we are seeing in the reflected story qualifies as folding. That's because the original story was a simple instance of what Lucas probably still believes is a universal myth. Enough time (36 years!) has transpired from the original trilogy and enough exposure through aggressive marketing that the original trilogy's instance has itself become the myth on which we now impress our story.Three examples: The other two films advance the story through task episodes, after which there is an escape-chase. In this third case, the film is essentially a collection of chase sequences during which the story is advanced. Because the backbone is a chase, and we have a mature editing grammar for chase episodes, the maturity of pacing is extraordinary. Blockbuster films have advanced this art and Abrams simply uses the best. There's even a situation of our heroes in corridors being hunted by stormtroopers that is filmed as a mini-chase. So, from my perspective, they've folded the confrontations into punctuations between motions.The second example: after all this time, we have competing on-screen narrators. Palpatine has been manipulating things all along and has magical insight into what our characters are doing. This is folding of the viewer into a character, but of an unimaginative kind. In a more noir-quoting film, we'd have periods where we are reminded that our on-screen drama is only because the hapless heroes are being manipulated for our entertainment. Mapping this viewer's narrative control to a villain is common.But we have something far more inventive and for this viewer, thrilling. Our two main characters can actually see each other, across galactic dimension and occupy a shared interspace. The conflict can be conveyed through this narrative space that we share with the two, especially in an extraordinary fight scene where each is projected into the other's space. But it is more than that. The entire new story that is imposed on the old, is about who sees into whom: Palpatine, Leia, Kylo, Rey, Luke, Han, and the mobs on each side have some vision and agency. Each is able to take action through this narrative space. Leia for instance significantly changes things by insight and narrative governance at a distance. Or is that Luke or Han or even Vader working through her?The third example... The original trilogy is a simple quest in the context of pure good and evil. In the first two in this trilogy, the quest is continued, with little change but a different character. In this final instalment, this is no longer the fabric, but the background for a Shakespeare-worthy love story folded into it. This is grownup stuff, and we can see the fan kids and those who want to be objecting. The Disney folks have made a bold choice I think, differentiating from their Marvel property and investing for the long run. Give me a quest for complex urges any day. That's a story fabric I can build my life around. Polar battles between good and evil don't help me and have made my world worse.",positive

"I don't quite know how to describe how disappointing this is. Ordinarily, I would expect to be shouting from the rooftops about it all but it's so poor. John Williams usually scores outstandingly well to compliment the action, but here he seems to be trying his best to replace it - the story at any rate, which is completely lacking in just about everything . The ""Kylo Ren"" character has never sat well - his constant personal conflicts would have ""Darth Vader"" spinning in his grave. The telepathic conversations between him and ""Rey"" are confusing, irritating and half the time don't add up - is he the baddie or isn't he?. The fight/battle scenes are superbly created but are far too long and there is an unenjoyable inevitability about them - Stormtrooper training seems predicated on the principle of the more of you that there are, and the better kit you have, then the more likely you are to be overwhelmingly defeated by someone wielding an electric toothbrush. Boyega, Isaac and Ridley are fine, they do their jobs - but there is no charisma on the screen; and nothing special about their performances. The idea that a state of the art interplanetary battle cruiser is being attacked by some folks on horse(?)back is absurd; and there is at best only a laughable attempt to create any menace or fear in the First (thankfully, also the Last) Order. It's end to end stuff, but to what end is more the point. Billy Dee Williams and Chewbacca do their best on occasion and C3PO has some quite witty one-liners; but Mark Hamill and, particularly Carrie Fisher, just seem to be there for the sake of it. Certainly the weakest of these last 3 Bad Robot efforts; and you certainly appreciate the chasm between this and the original trilogy.",negative
". . . I was fairly dismissive of all that jazz about the SITH being indistinguishable from the terrestrial Pachyderm Party. After all, I thought, Jerry ""Stumble-foot"" Ford reincarnated as ""Jar-Jar BINKS""?! ""Come on, get real"" an inner voice objected. However, as several new books out in the past two months document, STAR WARS IX: THE RISE OF SKYWALKER continues this saga's uncanny knack of dove-tailing closely with Real Life, from 1900s SITH ringleaders Noxious Nixon and Ford to more recent criminals, including The Gypper, The Weasel and The Orange Buffoon (obviously a dead ringer for Emperor PALPATINE). Just as Real Life unmasked the fact that Jar-Jar was a SITH mole, The Art of STAR WARS discloses that our POTUS #45 is a satanic SITH (aka, Red Commie Russian Kremlin KGB) asset, planted inside America's once-hallowed Oval Office to dance around like a marionette on strings--a pawn with no volition of its own, compelled to surrender wars, treasonously give up military secrets, betray and back-stab loyal allies, torment Ukraine and degrade the USA into a hellacious lawless knock-off of Mother Russia.

"An old villain resurfaces and Rey, who has been continuing Jedi training under Leia, following Luke's departure into The Force, finds herself facing an even greater threat than before.I don't want to put overt spoilers in an IMDB post, so I'll remain vague in my synopsis. Suffice it to say that the ninth - and final? - episode of the Skywalker saga wraps up most loose ends tidily and satsfactorily.It is clear in the storyline how much Carrie Fisher's unexpected death resulted in necessary retooling, but the plot still works well enough. It was good to have assorted cameos from old friends, even if many of them were blink-and-you'll-miss-'em voice cameos.The visuals, to me, weren't as good as usual - there was a lot of excess darkness where it was difficult to make things out, and also shaky camera work, both of which have become fashionable - contrast the climax of ROTJ, also dark and full of action, but an object lesson in clarity.Most of the criticisms I've read didn't matter too much to me. I did feel that The Force turned out to have areas which were somewhat unexpected (again!), and the sudden revelation of Force Dyads matched midichlorians as conveniently expedient plot devices. They weren't deal breakers for me, though.I enjoyed it hugely, and it repaired a lot of the samage Episode VIII had caused for me.",positive
"As soon as it was revealed that Rey is the granddaughter of Palpatine, and that Palpatine somehow still lives(!!???), I was officially done with this trilogy.Come on, how much can one story possible recycle from another? J.J. Abrams couldn't come up with anything as good as George Lucas's original story and characters, so he just borrows and mixes enough to try to fool us into thinking we're getting sequels rather than reboots, but he fails. Rian Johnson tried to take the story in some new and potentially interesting directions (though ""The Last Jedi"" had plenty of flaws in its own right), but all of them are thrown out the window in ""Rise of Skywalker."" It's like the second installment never even happened. The only moments that roused me from my theater seat were those that referenced the original trilogy.Worst of all, ""The Rise of Skywalker"" undermines even the modest joys to be had from ""The Force Awakens"" and ""The Last Jedi,"" because now we see the story in its entirety and are aware of how flimsy it all is. It's painfully obvious that this trilogy's story was made up as it went along and not conceived as a cohesive whole. That's what made the first trilogy so good, and even the second trilogy, dorky as it is, has a fantastic and well mapped story to tell. This is just Disney throwing spaghetti at a wall to see what sticks and hoping that ""Star Wars"" fans are so loyal to the franchise that they'll throw their money at any garbage as long as the ""Star Wars"" logo is attached to it.Grade: C",negative
"... which is that there was no overarching story to this trilogy planned.Say what you will about the prequels -years later they aren't considered secretly great or misunderstood. But they did one thing right. They expanded the universe of Star Wars with more world building and more lore, some good, some bad. The prequel story, while stilted, was the product of a single vision. In the end you had bad execution with good building blocks.The Sequel Trilogy doesn't expand anything, instead it makes everything smaller. Star Wars has never felt so small and tired as it does after The Rise of Skywalker. Each movie exists just to tear down and apologize for what came before it. Anakin/Vader's entire character arc is completely and unforgivably undermined after this film.Overall the movie was so bloated and overstuffed with choppy pacing to course-correct from The Last Jedi. It's Flanderization in action. The original movies had so many little touches and so much atmosphere and craftsmanship beyond a few big reveals, neat action set pieces, and bizarre coincidences with the same ten people running into one another over and over. The original films built iconic imagery and characters in the context of them doing things and bonding and building. This was not always perfectly done, but it was done well enough to feel meaningful.You can't just write a movie with the assumption you already have all of those things and skip the work it takes to get them. You can trick people for awhile by using the familiar imagery and beats and deconstructing the world with meta-humor (Abrams did that well for The Force Awakens if nothing else), but you just cash in that goodwill and cheapen all of that stuff by association.Oh well, the big action movies these days are indeed made for children and China - I can't remember who recently said that, but it's true.",negative
"And so my long Marvel-watching journey comes to an end; I've finally caught up with the endless franchise, after what seems like eons playing catch-up with the rest of the world's population. Sadly, this SPIDER-MAN sequel is a real step down from the highs of AVENGERS: ENDGAME, and a feeling like they've gone backwards given how they learnt what worked so well previously. Personally, I've found both of Holland's outings as the web-slinging hero to be middling at best.This one starts off okay, with a first half mixing the usual lame high school gags and characterisation with some decent and destructive set-pieces; Jake Gyllenhaal is a nice choice of supporting actor too. However, a crucial twist halfway through renders the second half extremely mundane, building to a climax which is silly and predictable as it is hollow and contrived. Fans tend to lap this stuff up due to its well-meaning nature, but I expect a lot more from this kind of budget.",negative
"It's eight months after the Blip, the moment when the people who got dusted in the Snap return after over five years. It's a period of readjustment as those people come to terms with the world five years later. Tony Stark is gone and Peter Parker (Tom Holland) has to fill some very large shoes. He and his friend Ned Leeds are set to go on an European school trip. Peter is struggling to make his move with MJ (Zendaya). In Venice, they are attacked by a water monster and they are saved by fish bowl head Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal) who claims to be Quentin Beck from another Earth.It would have been great to have Gyllenhaal be Holland's replacement mentor. I don't mind the expected villain turn although he probably has a few too many henchmen. As for Zendaya's MJ, her deadpan delivery holds some interest but could be limiting in future sequels. The main question I have is whether this franchise needed an European Vacation already. Most of time, a franchise should be stale before trying to refresh itself with exotic locations. I wouldn't mind more high school and more Aunt May to let his world breathe. The reason for a younger Peter Parker actor is for him to live more fully in the high school experience. At this pace, he's getting a job at the newspaper in the next movie and that would be a shame. He should be having more high school soap opera before then.",negative
"Spider-Man: Far from Home is a typical film for youngsters or fans of Marvel, CGI and explosions. The storyline is silly, the screenplay is not as funny as the writer intended to be and the hero is annoying. Anyway entertains if the viewer has lower expectation and does not have a better option. The cliffhanger in the credits is one of the best scenes. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Homem-Aranha: Longe de Casa"" (""Spider-Man: Far from Home"")",negative
"I do not work for Disney, but I suspect that they do not plan to stop making billions from their Marvel rights just yet; so while Endgame felt like a conclusion, certainly it is nothing of the sort. Far From Home is a well placed product then, much like Ant-Man and The Wasp was a bit of an amuse-bouche in the series, so too is this film a bit of a good old return to a smaller but engaging adventure. The plot sees Peter Parker trying to ignore the weight on hi and just enjoy an European vacation, although an interdimensional threat called an Elemental seems poised to disrupt all that.Much like the previous Spider-Man film, this one is fun, playful, but yet has a decent plot. There is good action, comedy, and nice moments, all producing the sense of an enjoyable romp with plenty to like about it. In terms of the brand, it is what was needed, but it is also an enjoyable film which has a lot of creativity and craft about it - not just money and polish. Of course there is that too, but it doesn't feel like a mass produced product in the way some of this genre can. Special effects are good of course, but also have a sense of wonder about how they are used. Performances are strong, with Holland in particular making the character his own. Zendaya is young and cool, and that works for her, but otherwise I didn't think she brought much to this. Gyllenhaal works well in the various forms of his character while Jackson, Favreau, Tomei, Batalon, and others add to the quality, They could have used Smooth more though, if anything his presence distracted due to how little he did.Far From Home is a fun film overall. It lifts the mood of the series with its humour, while also delivering an enjoyable adventure and engaging plot.",positive
"The film opens as a link to the last one with the incident being called the ""Blip."" People came back at the same age as when they left while everyone else aged five years. Peter's (Tom Holland) class does a getaway trip to Europe.

Emma Stone will always be my favorite Spiderman girl, but Zendaya exhibited promise. This is the first Marvel film without a Stan Lee cameo.",positive
"Before I even start, it is imperative that you have seen the previous movies. Especially Endgame of course, but also the others. Now this can be enjoyed as a standalone and readers of comics in general will have a great time anyway. But with all the previous entries in mind, I will not spoil this one, just going to assume you are up to date.Why do I say this? Well because this plays and this is the last ""warning"", directly after Endgame. So there have repurcussions, with losses and gains, but with a fight won. And apparently this has done something to our universe. It has opened doors. Spiderman has to be the one to step up, since others are either gone, incapable or really gone.It is tough to step out of the shadow of Iron Man and while you can blame him and his technology for certain things ... hm Peter Parker gets an inheritance of Stark technology ... so some might feel things are predictable, I personally was surprised by quite a few things, especially considering the little knowledge I had before the movie started ... It's a fun little movie and if you can't have fun with this it is a shame. The movie really achieves to entertain if you let it",positive
"More so than with the Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield takes on the Spider-Man character, it appears that the Tom Holland version is geared more toward a teen and young adult audience. Nothing wrong with that, because alter-ego Peter Parker is a teenager himself. But it just doesn't feel like a super-hero movie for me with all the high school kids running around and Spider-Man trying to get out of a world threatening assignment from Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). I was surprised to see Jake Gyllenhaal cast here as the film's principal villain, but liked the idea that he came on as a buddy-buddy to Peter before the reveal that showed him to be the mastermind behind the Elementals. The numbered Earth concept opens up a whole array of possibilities for future stories, so a franchise like this can go on forever. As a completist I'll be on board for future movies, though I'd like to see more in the way of character development and effective story telling. A little bit darker tone would also be of help.",positive
"Avengers: Endgame may have concluded the ongoing Avengers story that gradually developed since Iron Man, the first movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but that doesn't mean it will not continue with further films, this was the next instalment. Basically, in Mexico, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) are investigating an unnatural storm, and encounter the Earth Elemental, extradimensional creatures that use natural forces. A super-powered man, Quentin Beck (Jake Gyllenhaal), arrives to fight the creature. In New York City, the Midtown School of Science and Technology restarts its academic year to accommodate the students who were among those who disappeared in ""the Blip"" eight months ago. The school organises a two-week summer field trip to Europe. Peter Parker (Tom Holland), who is still distraught over the death of Tony Stark, is planning to confess his growing feelings for classmate Michelle ""MJ"" Jones (Zendaya), and he wants to take a break from heroics. Dressed as Spider-Man, Peter is forewarned by Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau), at a charity fundraiser organised by his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei), that he will be contacted by Fury. Peter chooses to ignore this, he leaves the event after being overwhelmed with questions about Tony Stark. Peter and his friends travel to Venice, where the Water Elemental strikes and wreaks havoc on the city, until Beck arrives and destroys the creature. Fury meets with Parker, he wants his help, and gives him Stark's glasses. The glasses are equipped with the artificial intelligence E.D.I.T.H. (which stands for Even Dead I'm The Hero) (voiced by Dawn Michelle King), which has access to all databases of Stark Industries and commands a large orbital weapons supply. Beck, who adopts the nickname ""Mysterio"", says he is from a different reality, one of many in the Multiverse, and he claims the Elementals killed his family. Peter rejects Fury's call to help Mysterio, opting to rejoin his class, but Fury covertly redirects the school trip to Prague, where the Fire Elemental is projected to strike. The creature appears at a carnival, Beck is eventually able to defeat it with the help of Spider-Man. Fury and Hill invite Parker and Beck to Berlin to discuss the formation of a new superhero team. Peter believes Beck is more worthy of being Stark's successor, and bequeaths him the E.D.I.T.H. glasses. But it is revealed that Beck is a former holographic-illusions specialist at Stark Industries, he was fired for his unstable nature. He leads a team of other disgruntled ex-Stark employees, using advanced projector drones they are simulating the Elemental attacks so Mysterio can masquerade as a hero. Intending to tell MJ his feelings for her, she assumes Peter is going to tell her that he is Spider-Man, which she already realised. MJ shows Peter a piece of debris she retrieved during the carnival battle, it is a projector that presents a simulation of the Air Elemental, they realise that Beck is a fraud. Peter travels to Berlin and meets with Fury, only to realise that it is an illusion created by Beck, this leads to a battle with multiple illusions before Fury apparently subdues Beck. Fury forces Peter to reveal anyone he told about Beck's deception, but this is revealed as another illusion. Peter is hit and badly injured by a train, falling unconscious he eventually waking in a jail cell in the Netherlands. Peter breaks out and contacts Hogan, who flies Peter to London, while a machine left by Stark synthesizes a new customized Spider-Man costume. In London, Beck uses E.D.I.T.H. to orchestrate his biggest illusion yet, a fusion of all four Elementals, and he plans to kill MJ and any others who know his secret. Peter breaks through the illusion, regains control of E.D.I.T.H., and defeats Mysterio. Beck ends up killed by a misfired drone gunshot. Parker returns to New York City and begins a relationship with MJ. Spider-Man and MJ are seen together in Times Square, then on a big screen is an announcement by reporter J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons) of TheDailyBugle, he blames Spider-Man for the Elementals' attacks. He then plays pre-recorded footage of Beck, who incriminates Peter for his death and then reveals his secret identity. It is also revealed Skrulls Talos (Ben Mendelsohn) and Soren (Sharon Blynn) have been masquerading as Fury and Hill the whole time, so that Fury can relax on a spaceship. Also starring Jacob Batalon as Ned Leeds, Tony Revolori as Flash Thompson, Angourie Rice as Betty Brant, Remy Hii as Brad Davis, J.B. Smoove as Mr. Dell, Martin Starr as Mr. Harrington, Jorge Lendeborg Jr. as Jason Ionello, Numan Acar as Dimitri, and Claire Rushbrook as Janice. British-born Holland reasserts himself as a spirited and wise-cracking hero, Jackson is both commanding and amusing as the Avengers boss, Gyllenhaal does well as the anti-hero, and Zendaya remains amusingly snidey as Spidey's love interest. The story is essentially Spider-Man battling evil whilst globetrotting, it is nice to see European sites along the way, the script is filled with wittiness and humour, and the special effects are jaw-dropping and add a lot to proceedings, it is a little by-the-book, but a satisfying superhero fantasy action adventure. Good!",positive
"As with Homecoming, I had a reasonable time with Far From Home, but found my overall enjoyment hampered by a few niggles.My biggest problem with the film is that there's very little feeling of genuine peril for our hero thanks to his impossibly fast reflexes and apparent indestructibility, the web-slinger surviving being hit full-on by a speeding train, getting set on fire, and being shot at by countless high-tech drones. Without any real sense of danger, there's very little excitement to be had, the action scenes washing over the viewer in a wave of fancy CGI extravaganza. Yes, the visuals are amazing (especially the trippy holographs Mysterio uses to fool Spiderman), but I never once felt moved by what I was seeing.I also found certain plot points difficult to accept: Tony Stark leaving control of EDITH to 16-year-old Peter Parker seemed unlikely, given the potentially deadly nature of the system, and, although staying relatively true to the comics, Mysterio's high-tech illusions take quite a bit of swallowing.Meanwhile, Marisa Tomei is (again) out of place as a very easy-on-the-eye Aunt May, with her character's relationship with Happy (Jon Favreau) most unlikely (sorry Jon, but she's out of your league).On the plus side, the humour is mostly effective (the Night Monkey gag made me laugh every time), Holland makes for a decent lead, and Zendaya is likeable as the his love interest M.J.6.5/10, but not good enough for me to round it up to 7.",negative
"I watched this at home on BluRay from my public library. My wife was out of town.This movie builds on a story of Peter Parker's school class trip to several European cities and ending in London, before they travel back to the states. There is some interesting interactions among the school kids, including Parker and MJ who has analyzed his activities for a while and is 67% certain that he really is Spiderman. He eventually confirms that and he becomes her boyfriend.My own problem with the movie itself, and I had the same issue with the prior one, the action gets so manic that it is impossible to follow exactly what is going on. It becomes sensory overload and almost a type of noise. I suppose the movie makers believe they need to do this, up the ante so to speak for each new movie, to generate interest.So in total I find it to be a mediocre action movie, too much reliance on digitally generated special effects, at the expense of compelling storytelling. And of course the ending sets up for the next sequel.",negative
"Granted, I haven't seen ""Avengers: Endgame"", so I am not sure what lies before ""Spider-Man: Far from Home"". But still, I was given the chance to watch this 2019 Marvel movie, so I did, even though I am not overly keen on the superhero genre.I must say, that like all other Marvel movies, then the 2019 ""Spider-Man: Far from Home"" was entertaining, and it was also a spectacular movie to watch on the screen.The storyline in the movie was entertaining and enjoyable, and it definitely had a great pacing to it. And also the twists and turns along the way were quite nice, as it made for a more non-linear movie actually.""Spider-Man: Far from Home"" is a special effects movie, through and through. And there is nothing bad to be said for the special effects and CGI, because they were phenomenal and bedazzling. I was genuinely impressed with the CGI and special effects in this movie.One thing I will never grasp is why they keep changing the storylines from previous movies. In this 2019 movie, Peter Parker (played by Tom Holland) is again to become romantically entangled with MJ (played by Zendaya). We have already seen this, and why suddenly change on the MJ character? Not going to start a racial debate here, but it just seems odds. But hey, that is Hollywood for you, I suppose, being all about pleasing the crowd and the minorities.The villain in this movie was actually among the best of any villain I have seen in the Marvel movies thus far. And they had opted for a very talented actor for the part. Not going to spoil who the villain is by revealing his name.The parts of Nick Fury (played by Samuel L. Jackson) and Happy Hogan (played by Jon Favreau) actually brought a nice element of comedy to the movie, without it tipping the scale and becoming too much.Now, I do watch superhero movies when given the chance, but it is not my preference of genres. But I will say that the 2019 ""Spider-Man: Far from Home"" was genuinely entertaining and enjoyable.",positive
"For every Marvel movie that comes out, beyond the big box office and throngs of fans that love every moment, there are those that like to ride their high and mighty horse, telling you that comics are for kids and that these movies are infantile. And that's fine - look, we all have our own opinions - but when you're fighting your way through life and just need a break that takes you away from your own cares - which is what movies are really for - these popcorn films do a great job of making you forget bills, work, dealing with fixing up your home and even your aches and pains.Basically: Yes, we get it. You're above comic book movies. Keep it to yourself, because these movies are modern myth and have never been better than right now.The twenty-third film in the Marvel Universe - soon, you'll need a whole shelf to hold all the blu rays - this film starts in Mexico, where Nick Fury (Samuel Jackson) and Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) battle an elemental creature alongside Quentin Beck (a great Jake Gyllenhaal) who will come to be known as Mysterio.Way back in the Sam Raimi days, Mysterio was to be the fourth film's villain. He was to be played by Bruce Campbell and there had been cameos in each of the three previous films to set him up. Sadly, that never came to pass.Meanwhile, Peter Parker (Tom Holland) is still learning how to adjust to life after ""The Blink,"" the five year period where Thanos wiped out half of all life, as well as the events of the last few movies like Avengers: Endgame. He's reeling from the loss of Tony Stark, his father figure, and also dealing with a crush on his friend MJ (Zandaya of HBO's Euphoria).Nick Fury has plans for Spider-Man, but Peter Parker has better ones this summer. He wants to attend a class trip to Paris and confess his feelings to MJ. Standing in his way are a series of elemental villains who are trying to destroy this Earth in the same way that they wiped out Mysterio's alternate Earth-833.There are at least three major plot twists that I have no interest in spoiler, other than to say that this was the best possible way to introduce Mysterio as the major villain in the life of Peter Parker. The mid-credits reveal of J. K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson drew loud cheers and applause in the theater I saw the film in, which made me smile. That's all the spoilers you're getting out of me, other than it's nice to actually be surprised by a film these days.Continuing the tradition of members of Spider-Man's Sinister Six showing up in minor roles - Mac Gargan (The Scorpion) and The Shocker were both in Spider-Man: Homecomng - one of Nick Fury's men is named Dmitri Smerdyakov, the real name of The Chameleon, who is the first supervillain to ever battle Spider-Man, all the way back in his first issue in 1963. Plus, Peter Billingsley (Ralphie himself!) reprises his role as William Ginter Riva from Iron Man. While he worked for Obadiah Stane back then, now he's part of Quentin Beck's entourage.Whether or not you appreciate this film depends on what camp you fall in as it relates to the opening of this piece. As for me, I'm pleased to report that the scenes where Mysterio manipulates reality are the best live action superheroics I've seen, a perfect spin on the visuals of the comic book world made wonderfully 3D. It's still not as great as Spider-Man: Into the Multiverse, but that's a movie that may never be topped.Hurry up and see it. The ending that sets up the next sequel made me start counting down the days to the next sequel!",positive
"This film tells the story of Spiderman saving Europe from destruction.The visual effects are stunning. Everything looks so real, you can just not tell they are fake. The damage to buildings look so real, but I just know that the Tower Bridge is still standing.The story is great because it gets into action basically right away. Peter is a sweet character as well, as he appears to be innocent and is a reluctant hero, literally. That gives his character more charm, and sets him apart from other superheroes. I really enjoyed this film.",positive
"I dip in and out of this whole MCU thing, but there's no denying its quality when it produces a film as good as this.Even without having watched the other films you can pick up the plot here (though of course it helps) as this works as just a fun Spiderman film, with good performances from Tom Holland, the ever lovely Zendaya, combining with lots of fun action sequences.These new Spiderman films are on a par with the Raimi trilogy.",positive
"The Spiderman franchise seems to be the one that is bucking the trend with the films actually getting better each time. The dynamic between Tom Holland and Jake Gyllenhaal in this is great and now that we don't have to pretend we don't know Spidey's identity, we can develop the character much more fully so the relationship with MJ is also taking better shape too. It's fast-moving, entertaining and the plot is fun. For a change, the CGI is complementary to the production rather than the sole reason for it. Good stuff, this!!",positive
"The events of Infinity War and Endgame(the immediate consequences of which are briefly explained in this, so you can go into this blind), which I am not going to spoil here, nor will I anything else, have come to a close. Peter Parker(Holland, remaining easily the best live action version of the character), understandably, wants to take a short break. He likes MJ(Zendaya, her snarky and darkly comedic exterior softened by her obvious awkwardness when dealing with love. She remains easily one of the best parts of the extensive(I mean that in the good way) supporting cast of the titular character, which is all fantastic), and thinks she likes him back, so he hopes to spend more time alone with her, and see if she does. Fortunately, he and the rest of his high school class are all going on a round trip of Europe. Unfortunately, the world of superheroics does not agree with his schedule. Nick Fury(L. Jackson, eternally badass) demands he help deal with the tremendous threat of the Elementals, beings made of the four natural elements - they came straight out of Mythology. Is he(like the movie itself is) going to be able to balance his personal life with his, say it with me, responsibilities?I'm not going to go into detail about Mysterio(Gyllenhaal, Playing every aspect of the character absolutely perfectly), other than say that his presence in this was amazing and lived up to everything I had hoped, from him appearing in a film, for the last 20 years. This is absolutely hilarious, which is just one of the countless parts where it matches, and frequently even tops, what Homecoming delivered. Director Jon Watts has gotten *a lot* better at dealing with his one weakness, action sequences. They are absolutely incredible. The half a dozen different settings, all of varying degrees of exotic(to an American audience at the very least), are all used optimally. And I realise at this point this does go without saying, but make sure you do not leave the theatre before all the credits have run, because... man, is it going to be tough, waiting for follow-up on those two scenes. I have no idea how the MCU keeps being this phenomenal.I recommend this to any fan of Spider-Man and/or teen comedies that feature romance. 8/10",positive

"Emotionally I was going into this movie with a lot of ambivalence and reservations. We're entering a whole new era. Iron Man is gone, Captain America is gone, and the Avengers as we know them are no more. So, what does Marvel do moving forward? I know that Spider-Man is his own superhero but every MCU movie had ties to the Avengers.I expected a flop. Gladly, I got a good movie.Spider-Man vacations in Europe and he's needed there. The enemies are creatures called Elementals and they take the form of various elements (e.g. water, fire, air, etc.). That's one of the reasons I thought this movie would be weak because Spider-Man already had to fight a similar looking thing in Spider-Man 3 with the Sandman. I was thinking, ""Who cares to see him fight water or fire? That's a horrible premise."" Thankfully, the movie was more intelligent than that.Quentin Beck aka Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal) ends up not being a superhero but a super-villain. I liked the twist. Even though it required a big production team and some next level tech I liked the idea of the Elementals being fictitious as opposed to real monsters. Furthermore, I wasn't too keen on a Mysterio as a superhero. He was too all-of-a-sudden and too generic.I also liked the Peter Parker-Mary Jane love story. It was more believable. They didn't overly romanticize it. It had a realistic awkward teenage feel to it and more of an innocence as well. I mean it helps that they both look like teenagers as well as opposed to the very adult Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst. Their upside-down kiss in the rain was akin to The Notebook or some other romantic film. In this movie it was more muted, kind of playful, and definitely awkward (as you would expect Peter Parker to be).In short, I was pleasantly surprised. The MCU is not dead and a movie like this is a good step towards maintaining its quality production while refilling the void left by the loss of the Avengers.",positive
"With Endgame still fresh in our memories (and our hearts), this film has huge shoes to fill, plus the fact that the whole Spider-Man franchise has gone through four different incarnations in the last 12 years, this film has a lot to prove.Well it proves itself in droves, as Far From Home cleanses the palate of what was a heavy meal with the events of Endgame.We know it has to have connotative elements to the rest of Phase 3, but the way it deals with it is light and breezy, and without sounding too macabre, downright funny in it's opening sequence with Betty Brant reading the school news.And this sets the mood for the rest of the film, and it's a relief that although Iron Man and Stark Industries are pivotal to the narrative, it doesn't dwell on death or the finger-snap, it lingers on hope and the fact that we do not stop, we go on, no matter what has tested us.Spider-man has always been the sunshine hero of the Marvel world, full of fun, colour, and vibrancy, and this is why Webb failed, and Marvel succeed, because this follows the winning formula of Homecoming.Holland nails it yet again as Parker, and here, we focus a lot more on Parker, him dealing with the loss of a mentor/Father figure, and his coming of age, not just with his gift, but with the predictability of him being a normal sixteen year old boy.When we join the class on holiday, this is where the film comes into it's own, the set pieces remind one of the heady days of the nineties, where there were probably only two or three tentpole films released in the summer, and these set pieces are just big, silly fun, and then we are introduced to Gyllenhall, who blows the film out of the water with Mysterio.It's a genius move to have someone who was in the running to play Spider-man at one time as a pivotal character, and Gyllenhall is really having fun as the troubled Mysterio, really living up to his name at times in the film.And then Far From Home goes from really good, to astounding, as the narrative turns on it's head. Yes, it may be a little predictable as to what certain characters motivations are, but their rationale is a wonderful inclusion that takes us right back to 2008.Add Jackson in an extended cameo, and a sub-plot involving Happy Hogan and Aunt May, Far From Home doesn't let the viewer suffer with MCU fatigue, as it just goes along for the ride, and has a lot of fun while it does it.You feel that a lot of weight has been lifted when you see this, it's what Spider-Man should be, a bright, fun-filled adventure, that never lets up, and keeps the viewer on it's toes.There is one scene that is a little dark toward the final act, it almost feels like the Scarecrow level from Arkham Asylum, but it's inventive, and again, quite important to the film.So all in all, it's a welcome sequel that is light in tone and heavy on set pieces.And the post credits sequence is by far the most mind blowing one from the MCU.",positive
So many effects and grand battles in Venice Prague and London. But such a weak story what they are fighting about is so boring. The racially diverse cast of teens is good but they aren't very charming. Jake Gyllenhaal is miscast as a villain. He talks like someone in an indie drama movie. In fact they all seem silly.,negative
"After looking forward to Endgame for a year and wondering how it was going to play out, I have to say, while I enjoyed it I was mildly disappointed with it too. Certain aspects of it I did not care for, the way certain characters portrayed and such. So, then I saw the film that immediately followed and have to say I enjoyed this one a bit more than Endgame despite how huge that movie was. Of course, this may be due to the fact I am a huge Spider-man fan and he and Hulk are my favorite two comic book super heroes. That may be another reason I was a bit disappointed by Endgame, because Hulk really did not do all that much and seeing a character whose trademark line in the comics is Hulk is the strongest there is! constantly get beat and be a non factor really irked me. Enough about that one though, this one was a really good movie and had a very well done Mysterio.The story has Spider-man/Peter Parker still coming to terms with the death of his mentor and the fact that life has moved on for so many people while it seems like he stood still. Thankfully, nearly all of the people Peter know looks to have been taken out by the snap, which is a bit hard to believe, but I'll role with it. He tires of being Spider-man and just wants to enjoy his class trip to Europe; however, his mom, Happy and Nick Fury all think he needs to continue being Spider-man as a strange threat appears and Spider-man must team up with the strange Mysterio to try and thwart it.Mysterio was done very well in this film, during one scene where he confronted Spider-man I kept thinking this is exactly how Mysterio fights. I did think that this film would feature Scorpion due to the last Spider-man film, but it was cool to see Mysterio who is one of my fave Spidey villains on the big screen. Tom Holland continues to do a good job as both Spider-man and Peter Parker, a trait the earlier two lacked as Tobey was good as Peter, but lacked Spidey's delivery and Garfield could deliver the constant barrage of insults to his enemies, but did not fit the role of Peter at all.All in all a very good Spider-man movie and the way this one ended makes me wonder who might the villain be in the next one. I am hoping it is Kraven the hunter as I can see him in the next film after what they established at the end of this one or maybe the Scorpion will make his entrance into the Marvel cinematic universe? Who knows, not particularly excited about the universe moving forward, but I am always happy to see the wall crawler on the big screen.",negative
"I never had any trouble with a spiderman movie but this one was i don't know a bit too childish at some points. I mean, the start it took a while before I really got into this movie. Somehow I even found it boring and the monsters attacking Venice or Prague I just don't care.But it's the effects that made me watch it further, and guess what. After 40 minutes i started to enjoy it. Again , due storyline and effects. The CGI is stunning. Naturally in a spiderman you need some jokes here and there and it does work with the glasses from Stark given to spiderman but some jokes are for me a bit too childish again.So much as I loved Homecoming (2017) on everypart so much i had my doubts about this one. Maybe it's the DC and Marvel world combining these days and created this in-between spiderman.Worth seeing for effects but not the best one for me.

"Spider-Man: Far from Home, that pleasing bit of Summer escapism that promised pretty much everything the first movie did. And it delivers; Holland still shines in the lead role, the villain is handled pretty damn effectively and the web-slinging is a lot of fun. There's a particular post-credit appearance that's a genuine delight (loved seeing this character again) and the humor provides just the MCU palate cleanser needed after the world-domination that was ""Endgame"". I enjoyed myself quite a bit.One aspect that surprised me is that, just as in the first movie, Tony Stark is once again leaned-on fairly heavily here; and it wasn't a sore spot for me this time. I think it was handled rather well.",positive
"I was quite dissatisfied with the story. The plot was convoluted, with a lot of personal issues that either went nowhere or went really off-book (can't say much about it without spoiling it, but you'll see). The ending was a bit predictable, then was somewhat invalidated by the end credits scenes. Technically it was great, the acting was top notch - maybe except for the annoying sidekicks that brought nothing to the film, but it felt off. Too technical, perhaps, I just didn't feel it. The jokes fell flat, the action was pointless because there was no back story and the big reveal came after the credits. Seriously, you just have to watch the end credits scenes to understand much of the film.Bottom line: merely average.",negative
"Another day, another Halloween-friendly horror anthology, still made for kids but a little more adult in tone than something like GOOSEBUMPS. This in fact feels a lot like TRICK 'R' TREAT but is nowhere near on the level of that movie, and a lot of the time I felt like I was watching a deliberate STRANGER THINGS imitator. There are five stories collected here, and they're all entirely predictable, with youths or youngsters menaced by various CGI nasties. Killer spiders, scarecrows and madness are the order of the day, the highlight being the scenes in which the gang are harassed by a creepy contorted corpse monster which looks great. The rest is merely okay; I've seen a lot better and I've seen a lot worse, and this sits somewhere in the middle.",negative

"The film takes place in Mill Valley, Pa. 1968 at Halloween and nearing the Nixon election. Some teens break into a haunted house that belonged to the town founders.

While in the house, Stella (Zoe Margaret Colletti) swipes a hand written book of the stories, supposedly written in blood.

"Some stories are scary, some are not so scary. The trailer for this suggested a couple of scary things. And if you are not used to horror movies, I reckon this might scare you more than if you have seen your fair share of horror movies, which will make you numb to certain things.This is Hollywood and you should expect certain things (no pun intended). Scares will be thrown in and they will work to a degree. But the cliches and the predictability of it all, make it hard to really care.

"Strictly a film for teens about teens caught up in an ancient legend situated in the fictional town of Mill Valley, Pennsylvania. The year is 1968 and the specter of Vietnam and the election of Richard Nixon as President hovers in the background. Some might consider those two events as the scariest thing about the movie, although minor thrills are provided by the appearance of a sadistic scarecrow and a book that writes it's own stories in blood. A trio of teenagers are sacrificed in service to the story as Stella Nichols (Zoe Margaret Colletti) and Ramon Morales (Michael Garza) attempt to locate and confine the source of horror that pervades the small town on this particular Halloween night. The idea behind the 'jangly man' was kind of interesting but the character itself was kind of clunky, utilizing a similar effect that allowed Linda Blair to climb the walls in ""The Exorcist"". The writers seemed to be hinting at some sort of sequel with principal character Stella opining that this story wasn't quite over yet, but if that's the case, the follow up will more than likely deal with zombies from the after life. Or not, one will have to wait and see.",negative
"The trailer for this scary movie looked interesting, it is based on a series of children's book, but this is definitely not for children, whether it would be scary or good was another question, written and produced by Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth, The Hobbit Trilogy, The Shape of Water), directed by André Øvredal (Trollhunter). Basically, set in 1968, on Halloween, in the small town of Mill Valley, Pennsylvania, three teenage friends, Stella Nicholls (Zoe Margaret Colletti), August ""Auggie"" Hilderbrandt (Gabriel Rush) and Charlie ""Chuck"" Steinberg (Austin Zajur), play a prank on school bully Tommy Milner (Austin Abrams).

They thank him by taking him with them to a local haunted house which belonged to the Bellows family who helped found the town. Inside, they find a secret room and a book of scary stories belonging to Sarah Bellows, a name that has become legendary in the town, as she famously went insane. Having followed the group, Tommy locks them inside the room along with his girlfriend Ruth (Natalie Ganzhorn), who is also Chuck's sister. They are released by an unseen presence and escape. In her room, Stella discovers that a new story named ""Harold"" is being written in Sarah's book and the main character is Tommy. While a drunken Tommy is delivering food to the neighbours, he is stalked by a scarecrow called Harold, he is stabbed by the creature before vomiting hay and violently transforming while calling for help. Tommy is reported missing the following day. Unsettled, Stella and Ramón investigate and find a scarecrow wearing Tommy's clothes. Stella is convinced that Tommy has been turned into a scarecrow, but the others are sceptical, and Ramón is hesitant to go to the police because of a previous altercation. That night, Stella and Ramón witness a new story being written titled ""The Big Toe"" with August as the main character. The pair attempt to warn Auggie of the threat, while he unwittingly eats the toe, and the living corpse looking for it is stalking him. Auggie tries to escape and then hide, but the corpse drags him under the bed, and he disappears. Terrified and realising they will be next; the group try and fail to destroy the book by burning it. Following this, they decide to research the past of Sarah Bellows to find a way to stop the hauntings. Ruth discovers a large spot on her cheek, a spider bite, at the same time a new story, ""The Red Spot, is written, with her as the main character. Ruth tries to squeeze the spot, but it explodes and releases hundreds of spiders upon her. The group finds her and gets rid of the spiders, and Ruth is taken to the ""nuthouse"" to recover. The group's investigations take them to a psychiatric hospital where they discover Sarah's brother Ephraim was performing electroshock therapy on her to hide the fact that the family's mill had been poisoning the town's water with mercury, killing children. Chuck is attacked by ""The Pale Lady"", an obese phantom from his recurring nightmares. Chuck is cornered by the phantom in a hallway and it absorbs him. Stella and Ramón as too late, as the only thing they find Chuck's pen, they are then arrested by Police Chief Turner (Gil Bellows), who reveals that Ramón has avoided compulsory military service. In their cells, Ramón reveals he skipped the draft as his brother was sent home ""in pieces,"" making him scared of serving in the army. Turner's dog begins to act strangely, and Ramón realises the next creature will be The Jangly Man, a monster from a campfire story that scared him, titled ""Me Tie Dough-ty Walker"". The Jangly Man, able to build itself from body parts, kills Turner before attempting to kill Ramón. Stella and Ramón escape their cells, Ramón tries to lure the creature away while Stella goes to the Bellows house to try to reason with Sarah (Kathleen Pollard). Stella is taken back in time and lives out Sarah's experience as Ephraim terrorises her. Ephraim drags Stella into a dark room, where she encounters Sarah's ghost. In the present, Ramón is hunted by The Jangly Man in the Bellows House. Stella begins tearfully recites the true story of what happened to Sarah Bellows: she was victimized by her family for trying to reveal the truth, which turned her into a rage-filled monster. Sarah used the power of the book to kill her family but was unable to move on and kept killing anyone who removed her book. Stella promises to tell Sarah's real story if she stops killing. Sarah and The Jangly Man vanish after Stella is forced to write her story in the book, in blood. Ruth recovers and Ramón finally drafted into the army, while Stella, still holding Sarah's book, makes a promise to herself that she will find a way to bring Auggie and Chuck back. Also starring Breaking Bad's Dean Norris as Roy Nicholls and Lorraine Toussaint as Lou Lou. It is a simple premise, anyone named in a haunted book becomes the victim of a bizarre and grizzly death that plays on their fears, as detailed in their ""story"", the highlights are the sinister scarecrow character, the ridiculous looking but equally disturbing fat blob thing in the hospital, and the large zit bursting with spiders, this film does rely heavily on attempted jump scares, which are mixed, and I agree that it could have used the 1960s backdrop a bit more, but it's a traditional fright fest, a reasonable horror.

"1968. Misfit aspiring writer Stella Nicholls (an excellent performance by Zoe Margaret Colletti) and her oddball friends Auggie Hilderbrant (likeable Gabriel Rush) and Chuck Steinberg (the equally engaging Austin Zajur) discover a book of terrifying tales written by notorious murderess Sarah Bellows. Stella and her friends soon find themselves in great danger when said scary stories start coming true in extremely deadly and horrible ways.Director Andre Overdal relates the enjoyably twisted narrative at a constant pace, expertly crafts a spot-on spooky ooga-booga atmosphere, offers a flavorsome evocation of the 1960's period setting, and stages the scare set pieces with considerable skill and aplomb. This film further benefits from several cool'n'creepy creatures: A lethal scarecrow, an emaciated corpse looking for its missing big toe, a pasty fat ghoul, and, most frightening of all, a marvelously grotesque bendy freak that can detach its limbs and reassemble itself. Better still, the stories smartly tap into deep-seated basic fears that all the characters suffer from and the backstory for Sarah Bellows proves to be surprisingly poignant.The fine acting by the tip-top cast helps a lot: Michael Garza as handsome and charming draft dodger Ramon Morales, Austin Abrams as mean bully Tommy Milner, Gil Bellows as the skeptical Chief Turner, Natalie Ganzhorn as the snippy Ruth, and Lorraine Toussaint as the rattled Lou Lou. Roman Osin's striking widescreen cinematography presents a wondrous wealth of macabre images. The shivery score by Anna Drubich and Marco Beltrami hits the spine-tingling spot. A cracking good horror winner.",positive
"I knew very little about this film going in and, judging from the title, expected a horror anthology along the lines of Creepshow (1982). What I actually got was a very tired ghost story, one that treads familiar ground and regularly resorts to loud noises to try and make the viewer jump (or in the case of my friend, who fell asleep in the cinema, to wake them up).Based on the books of the same name by Alvin Schwartz, and directed by André Øvredal (Troll Hunter, The Autopsy of Jane Doe), the film follows a small close-knit group of high-school kids (as in Stranger Things and IT) who invoke the wrath of a vengeful ghost when they steal her book of scary stories. Each of the youngsters meets a fate in accordance with one of the stories in the book. The only way to stop the ghost is to unravel the mystery surrounding her death.Øvredal delivers one or two nicely realised creepy creatures along the way (the monsters apparently faithful to the illustrations in Schwartz's books), but the pace is slow, the when the kids investigate the history of the ghost, the film grinds to a halt (which is around the point that my friend dozed off). The whole 'unravelling of the past to put a spirit to rest' idea is as old as the hills, and the film even includes that oft-told urban legend about the girl who has baby spiders burst out of her face (as already seen in 1987 horror The Believers and Urban Legends: Bloody Mary from 2005).4/10. The anthology format I expected might have worked better.",negative
"Ever since 2007, and year after year on the 31st of October, I've been hoping to stumble upon another great Halloween-themed horror movie like I did in that year with ""Trick 'r Treat"". Alas, though, none of the movies that came since could live up to the greatness of ""Trick 'r Treat""; - not even the ones I had high expectations for, like Patrick Lussier's ""Trick"" or David Gordon Green's update of ""Halloween"". The confidence in this year's film selection was once more very big. And yet again, I've been let down...""Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark"" certainly isn't bad, but I honestly admit I hoped for something much scarier, and for sure for something a lot more original. The only genuinely inventive part is the narrative structure. Like most people, probably, I was set for a traditional sort of horror anthology with separate stories and a wraparound tale to connect the segments. But ""Scary Stories etc..."" is a totally different type of omnibus, with short segments integrated into a full-fledged film. The setting and era are perfect, as the plot takes place in a quiet little town on Halloween's eve in the year 1968. ""Night of the Living Dead"" plays at drive-in theaters, Nixon is getting elected as President, teenagers go out trick-or-treating even though they are too old for it, and the night ends with an illegal trespassing of the local haunted house. The heroic horror-nerds (with names like Stella, Auggie and Chuck) steal a book from a hidden basement in the house, but soon wish they hadn't. The book belonged to a poor girl who got abused and locked up in the cellar by her family, but even a hundred year later she still writes deadly stories.The plot and short stories are shockingly mundane and derivative. I mean, a bully turning into a scarecrow? Spiders crawling out of a beauty queen's face? Getting dragged under the bed by an unseen monster? These things we have seen numerous times before already, but I didn't see any new or innovative aspects at all. Despite the promise in the title, there's aren't any scary moments throughout the film (at least not if you have watched horror before and/or if you're over twelve) and gore or bloodshed is definitely something you shouldn't hope for.",negative
This film relies heavily on disturbing visuals. I don't find it engaging or thrilling. Just disturbing.,negative
"It must be old age but 2019 has produced half a dozen so-called ""horror"" films that are about as terrifying as running out of milk. This has one of the better, though still pretty derivative, storylines; and at times can be quite dark, but the use of teenagers as the conduits for the fear just isn't convincing. The plot, such as it is, is remarkably forgettable and the effects rely heavily on (admittedly some very effective) sound editing.

". . . by the Corrupt ""Conservative"" Communist Corporate Fat Cat One Per Center Class. SCARY STORIES TO TELL IN THE DARK centers around how this deplorable Pachyderm Party ilk (Real Life archival footage of POTUS ""Tricky Dick Nixon"" is generously sprinkled throughout SCARY STORIES) pervades even the smallest towns in the so-called ""Red States"" (or Hellfire-colored nether regions). Global Warming deniers and Pollution Profiteers such as SCARY STORIES' ""Bellows Family"" eat their own young, in the rare instance when they give birth to a human child with a soul (such as ""Sarah Bellows""). SCARY STORIES documents how these greedy, gluttonous Elephantine ogres contaminate ANYTHING and EVERYONE in their vicinity. This flick holds out little hope for those regions of the USA already tainted by Pachyderm Paranoia. Perhaps it's best to make a fresh start, the ending of SCARY STORIES suggests, and declare this southerly and westerly Land of the Lost to be a ""No Go Zone.""",negative
"The film doesn't waste too much time getting into the storyline, kids on Halloween visit the local creep house and discover a book of scary stories which then begin to write themselves leaving the kids to panic and try and find a way to stop their friends from dying horrible deaths. The monsters are well rendered and provide good scares, definitely jumped a few times. The acting by the kids is a little lackluster, no depth to their characters and lines are delivered like they are reading them. The first 3/4 of the movie is pretty good, and the plot seems to be moving along fairly nicely. But then the ending comes, and it feels very cheap. It's a very uninspiring ending; a bit of a letdown for what otherwise could have been a decent movie.",negative
"SCARY STORIES TO TELL IN THE DARK (2019) **1/2 Zoe Margaret Colletti, Michael Garza, Gabriel Rush, Austin Zajur, Dean Norris, Gil Bellows, Lorraine Toussaint, Natalie Ganzhorn, Austin Abrams, Kathleen Pollard. Creepy horror tale based on Alvin Schwartz' novel about a group of friends who unwittingly unleash a supernatural force when they discover a book of titular tales in a haunted mansion on Halloween which endangers each and every one of them. While the freaky looking monsters and apparitions are spot-on, the fine young ensemble of unknowns and decent direction by Andre Ovredal there's a want for more (or even darker dread) then what is onscreen in spite its shepherding by executive producer and fellow filmmaker of the genre Guilermo del Toro (who adapted the story with Marcus Dunstan and Patrick Melton).",negative
"Three teenagers visit a haunted house at Halloween and find a book in which the local spooky girl from 100 years ago wrote - and continues to write, it seems - scary stories. And those stories come true even as writing appears on the page...This film is apparently taken from a series of books with which I am not familiar. Taken on its own merits, it's not bad. The stories are nicely creepy, the linking device works very well, there's not too much creeping around dark corridors, the teenagers actually look like teenagers, there are a couple of nicely realised monsters, and everything potters along pretty well.If you fancy a bit of mild horror, you could do a lot worse than this.",positive
"I was expecting this movie to be scary like Goosebumps, which is to say not scary at all, but still entertaining. No, this was a legitimate scary movie, complete with chilling build up and grossly mutated creatures that haunt your dreams. With no blood to speak of and nothing in the way of stomach-turning grotesquery this movie was still able to bring the scares.In 1898 or so a girl named Sarah was locked in her family's basement as a punishment. There is where she died, or so the rumor went. After her death if kids would come to the house and say, ""Sarah tell me a story"" she would tell a story that would come true and be the cause of the demise of the recipient.On Halloween 1968 in Mill Valley, Pennsylvania a group of kids went to this now abandoned mansion and Stella (Zoe Margaret Colletti) asked Sarah to tell her a story. As she and her friends found out, the rumors were true-Sarah would tell a story that would come to fruition.This was one of those rare movies for me in which I liked the teenage characters in it. There was the stereotypical bully but none of the other tropes existed. Chuck (Austin Zajur) was probably my favorite character. He was the comic relief and he instantly brought levity to a situation with a simple facial expression.This movie does bring up thoughts of The Ring. This movie's supernatural antagonist was Sarah, The Ring had Samara. Sarah's stories meant the death of an individual, Samara's visions meant the death of an individual. Both were wronged and both continued to torment from the afterlife.I don't want to make it sound like it is just like The Ring because it isn't. I'm just digging through my memory archives to find a similar movie. Scary Stories is its own thing. Though dark and scary it had a touch of lightness to it separating itself from real horrors. It is actually pretty unique. Usually a movie is one or the other: all-in scary or comedic with a scary story. This was scary enough while throttling back at times to give the audience relief.",positive
"In fact this is made for the youngsters among us that is clear but being a horror it do offer some moments for those geeks.The story is easy to pick up, Halloween night, visisting an abandoned house pick up a book and things come alive. When nothing scary is happening I found it just on the edge of boring. Youngsters will ove that part, you know, nerdy chick and friends against the tough guys. No, that wasn't my cup of tea but the parts were the book comes alive and the scary stories are happening are really a must see. And naturally, the first story is okay but the last one immediately reminded me of The Thing (1982).So maybe as a family you will enjoy this, checking as an adult your social life while the youngster are enjoying the easy parts and as an adult loving horror you will find the horror the greatest thing.

"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark is a scary film, but a scary film in format only. Not a bad movie which is more geared for kids and Scary Stories is sort of like the It movie. There is the ground work for a small town with teenage characters from 1969 who are bullies, out casts and a stranger from a strange land several states over with a mystery to tell. What works for Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark is the character development which unfolds along with the vengeful spirit story. A old concept, but done in a way which keeps the audience interested. The scares are lame, but the of the late 60's events and what happen in the towns past makes for a good background story which puts the audiences into the story. The back of Scary Stories creates a big build up, but a bit of a let down for a scary ending. But the movie is still entertaining tho. 6 stars.",positive
"I wouldn't catalogue this movie as a very scary movie even though it contains a couple well made evil figures. The kind of monsters or creatures that scare my wife or younger kids, but if you're a hardcore horror fan this movie won't really scare you. But it's enjoyable and that's all I needed it to be. The acting is what it is, not Oscar winning performances but certainly not bad either. The storyline is a bit simplistic but overal it fits in the spirit of this movie. I enjoyed the movie and the reactions of my wife, and that's good enough to me to have some fun.",positive
"Over the summer just this past week I read all of the"" Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark"" books by Alvin Schwartz and I must say I enjoyed most of the short fable like fairy tale stories that involved being scared and feeling haunted as it's backdrop was that of folklore, myths, and legends passed down from generation to generation. Most of the stories were between one to three pages nice short and quick reads. The movie tried yet let down a little bit as it was set with certain kids I wish the film would have been more of an anthology mixed with many tales during the whole movie like something similar to ""Creepshow"", ""Twilight Zone"", ""Tales from the Darkside"" or ""Tales From the Crypt"" instead.Still the movie is watchable as it plays with it's audience in a fairy tale like way set in 1968 at the height of culture change like war, Nixon, and rebellion it follows a group of small teens. As friends they face the normal problems of growing up and fitting in however things change when they find a haunted mansion and a book left by a girl named Sarah and it becomes a haunt to all of their fears. It's just like the stories come aloud and alive and things happen to them one by one it's like they write their chapter and fate in life! The movie has some scary scenes and it tries to sell fright, really it's a mix of drama and black dark comedy. If you want to stay more true to folklore, legend, witches, monsters, and strange and funny twist read the books from Schwartz.",negative
"Also...I Know What Stranger Things You Did Last Creepstory. Always.For a movie that plays homage to SO MANY CLASSICS and still beats its own drum is a movie I will admire for many years to come. In fact, I've put off watching this until the obscene price for streaming came down and even though I found out it's available free on a 2-month-only subscription I recently got a steal for ($0.99/2 months with Showtime - from Prime Day,) I still immediately bought it, after I finished it, for $7.99 on Amazon to OWN.I LOVED this haunted story and not even a fan of ghost tales. In fact, of my top 100 favorite horror movies, it contains an alarming low number of THREE Ghost Stories. (Four when I throw this baby in there next update.) But, since it's so much more than a ghost story and the stakes are as real as they get, I'm fully invested. Hell, even the main theme, ""Season of the Witch"" is sung by one of my all-time favorite artists: Lana Del Rey.I thought this movie was an anthology so when 25-28 minutes of the wraparound/setup was still in progress, I was concerned. Nope, but it is, as the Title insists: STORIES to TELL. Preferably, scary ones. In the dark. Of course. But, that's just a deconstruction.Beautifully, this movie throws multiple storylines, settings and characters at us up front, without confusing any of them and the perfect amount of information is bestowed for us to grasp what our protagonists will eventually feel. Stella, a loner Wednesday-type, her two best buds, a hunky new potential bf and many more are caught within an old witch's curse surrounding a book. This book can predict the victims' demise and maybe, if all the cooks in the kitchen can work together, they can resolve this before...just kidding. There will be conflict. And blood, no doubt.Speaking of which, this is PG-13 and while the blood isn't the lead like in the adult R-Rated films, the scares in this movie were unique and actually WAY more effective than if it had been a Rated-R film's gorefest. This is like the Terminator being ordered Not to Kill by John and having to spend the entire movie being creative with multiple workarounds. It did it perfectly.To add to everything else, including a beautifully shot movie, very realistic characters/motivations/emotions and a well-established and haunting mood, we have incredibly good-looking leads: Michael Garza (""Ramon"") and Austin Zajur (""Chuck."") Don't worry, they're both of age. Ha. As always, the people playing teens are older. But, I was absolutely certain throughout Zajur was also the school bully in Halloween (2007.) I was incorrect, though they're not too far off in age.I digress. If you have a subscription to Showtime, see this movie NOW. If not, just buy it for $7.99. Hundred percent worth it and maybe you'll be telling your own scary stories in the dark.Who knows? They may hurt or heal.***Final thoughts: Wish I had seen this as a young adult or younger. I know I'd rank this so high on my top 100 list and cherish it for the remainder of my life like other horror classics like Halloween, Child's Play, Sleepaway Camp, Any Friday/Nightmare film and Final Destination. Just to name a few scarier...and sentimental stories to me.",positive

"THE DEAD DON'T DIE is another quirky existential comedy from writer/director Jim Jarmusch, but not as strong as previous films I've seen from the director. This one's yet another zombie outbreak comedy and the good news is that it's much better than the ZOMBIELAND flicks, but it still struggles to hits its mark as a comedy. The main roles, as taken by Adam Driver and Bill Murray, are rather dry and underplayed and simply not very amusing; supporting actors like Caleb Landry Jones, Steve Buscemi and Danny Glover are much better, although you want more of them. Tilda Swinton is irritating in the way the director venerates her. The zombie material is extremely familiar and there isn't much to be said or done about endless scenes of humans battling zombies, but some of the quirky character interplay hits the mark; I was just left wanting more of that and less of the generic.",negative
"In the tiny town of Centerville, Police Chief Cliff Robertson (Bill Murray) and Officer Ronnie Peterson (Adam Driver) confront Hermit Bob (Tom Waits). Officer Mindy Morrison (Chloë Sevigny) is the other police officer. Zelda Winston (Tilda Swinton) is the weird new mortician. Farmer Miller (Steve Buscemi) and Hank Thompson (Danny Glover) are two of the locals having breakfast at the diner. Zoe (Selena Gomez), Jack (Austin Butler), and Zack (Luka Sabbat) are passing through the town. Strange things are happening. The earth is off its axis blamed on polar fracking. Then zombies.Director Jim Jarmusch is trying for a meta hipster zombie comedy. It's a more dead-pan and less funny Shaun of the Dead. I'm not his biggest fan and I often rate his films a step lower than the critics. His sense of humor is a little too hip for me. This one is simply trying for fun. It's not trying to be that smart. Bill Murray is perfect for the dead-pan especially without the anger to taint it. The cast is talented and they're having fun. It really translates onto the screen. There are a few truly hilarious scenes. A sword welding Tilda Swinton is super fun when joined with the three small town cops. Sure there is a Star Wars joke but it's so awkwardly done that it's meta hilarious. This is one of the few Jarmusch film that I like much more than the general critical community. I'm just not highbrow like that.",positive
"Jim Jarmusch is an accomplished filmmaker, but has clearly been listening overmuch to sycophantic praise over the years. That old saw about someone so talented you could listen to them reading the phone book aloud doesn't pertain to JJ, who has consciously made a lousy horror film akin to the license pornographers use when making ""porn-parody"".Rounding up famous, big-name talent to walk through nothing roles, and then execute, rather than actualily satirize horror movie cliches is of zero interest, and why a top tier storyteller would waste the considerable effort it takes to make a real feature film on worthless material like this is beyond comprehension.If ""fake hipness"" is what Jarmusch wants to be remembered for rather than an original talent, this is certainly a proper nail in his coffin. I'd also be interested in the formula of the kool-aid he served this cast to get them to sign up for such menial roles.",negative
"The Dead Don't Die is an American mix between fantasy, horror and comedy from 2019, so a really recent release and the writer and director is American filmmaker Jim Jarmusch, who was roughly 65 when he made this. It runs for 105 minutes and you could say despite the pretty shocking (and sometimes also surprisingly graphic) key plot point that has zombies kill humans in a small town, it is a fairly slow film. This slowness is frequently linked closely to the comedy. There definitely is a touch of Fargo (the film, don't know about the series) to it, only that the two sheriffs here are not catching or trying to catch any criminals, but instead they are going for zombies. As for the cast, you will find many names who Jarmusch has worked with in the past on his uncountable previous projects. The two male actors at the center are Bill Murray and Adam Driver, who not too long also was the lead in Jarmusch's Paterson. Add to that Oscar nominee Chloë Sevigny and a whole lot of supporting cast members that you will recognize immediately. Feel free to check the cast list for those. The comedy in this movie is very subtle. Moments like 3 people independently asking each other if it was a wild animal that killed the two ladies at the cafe or several wild animals were already the top of show comedy. Driver has a nice little reference to his Star Wars success. But take for example the moment when Driver's character tells Murray's that he thinks zombies did it. Ghouls. A very random unfounded idea. And yet it does not get questioned from the beginning and even before there is evidence it is taken for granted. Until, as unrealistic as it actually is, reality confirms it when the undead lady from the prison cell suddenly rises. Also in this film is Tilda Swinton who channels a mix of Legolas from Lord of the Rings and the Bride from Kill Bill. Actually if the film and the writing had been any better, she could have been a real cult character, especially with the way how she exits the movie. Now that was unexpected. But random humor that comes out of completely nowhere is a key thing to this movie. But maybe she also isn't too unique anymore, for example with the references I gave.This is also a film that is very aware of itself. One early mention of the title song or I should say the ""title song"" because Driver's character knows it all, was fun and this is continued near the end when he even says something like Jim had him read the script and that's why he knows how the story continues. That's also why he is not sad when Savigny's character commits suicide in contrast to Murray's. He only knows their scenes/lines, or wait then he would know about the suicide too, right? Is he just playing to be sad and shocked. Who knows. Could it all be true? Anyway, it is still most of all a comedy I guess, even if very young audiences probably shouldn't watch. And that is pretty surprising because not only the two main characters die at the end, but also many supporting characters. Not many make it out alive. The guy in the woods who was accused early on to have stolen the chicken does. Does Buscemi's? I am not sure. Oh and pay attention to Selena Gomez. How did she end up in this movie and it was actually more than a cameo overall, even if the scene when we only see her head somewhat feels like one. Certainly her most memorable moment. Also the quotes that come from the trio of main characters following this scene. These comments actually capture the film or the comedy component of the film at its very core. It's never in your face, almost always subtle, and sometimes funny, sometimes not so much. I can somewhat see why many people did not like it and critics also did not really approve. It is not for everybody. The human characters sometimes are also moving and talking like zombies I must say. Still all in all, I believe this was a good watch. You should check it out perhaps. Also it did feel really Jarmusch to me, like some of the quotes and dialogues could have been taken right out of Coffee and Cigarettes if you ask me. So if you like the filmmaker, go see it. But don't expect greatness. Even I as a huge Bill Murray fan, who also likes Driver, cannot say this was a great movie. Certainly inferior to his previous release Patterson, if it is even possible to compare these two. The subjects could not be any more different.",negative
"In Centerville, the undead rise when there is a shift in the axis of rotation of Earth. ""The Dead Don't Die"" is the slow development of this storyline following several dwellers of this town. Films by Jim Jarmusch are usually cult and slow paced. His navigation through the zombie genre is an uneven film, with at least a good surprise like the flying saucer scene and many boring and unfunny moments. The cast composed by many veteran actors and actresses is a plus but the final result is neither cult nor worthwhile spending 1h 44 min watching.

"In the fictional Western Pa. town of Centerville ( a real nice place near Latrobe) the dead come back to life because of polar fracking which is also lengthening the days. Bill Murray who got his head blown off in his previous zombie film returns as Chief Cliff Robertson. The town of less than 800 people has its own TV station, motel, and restaurant. The earth's rotation is also a mess extending the day. Hermit Bob (Tom Waits) is our voice of reason, a role that has Woody Harrelson written all over it. At the end, he explains the zombie metaphor. Bill Murray gets to kill Carol Kane who haunted him in ""Scrooged."" The skewed day appears to be a homage to ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" famous for its day then suddenly night scenes as Ed Wood didn't think anyone would notice. Tilda Swinton reminded me of Uma Thurman from ""Kill Bill"" as she plays a Scottish Samurai undertaker. George Romero is mentioned when a Pontiac Lemans drives up, although it was the wrong year and color. The biggest building in this small town was the Juvenile Correction Center. Steve Buscemi plays a bigot whose coffee is ""too black"" and wears a cap, ""Make America White Again"" around Danny Glover, an activist in real life. Iggy Pop walks around as a zombie with a pot of decaf. Sturgill Simpson whose soundtrack was plugged many times, also plays a zombie dragging a guitar. Rosie Perez has her name changed a bit as newscaster Posie Juarez. Adam Driver who plays Kylo Ren on ""Star Wars"" has a Star Wars key chain.

"From very early on you can feel that the movie (script) is acknowledging the viewer. The moment it should be clear for everybody is when the theme song is playing on the radio - the explanation for it is something to behold. But the movie also gives nods to the actors involved and their previous work. Be it in film or music.Just because this is funny though, it doesn't hold back on the gory and visceral elements of a horror/zombie movie. Why Jim Jarmusch decide to do this, I don't know, but either he is a real fan (nods to Romero, cliches being included and so forth) of the genre or he read up on it. Whatever the case, if you don't mind silly and self deprecating humor, you will be very amused by this and entertained of course. If you are faint of hearted, easily offended or just can't bring yourself to laugh at certain things ... you will be annoyed.

"I don't go in for the straight zombie flicks so much, but I do enjoy the parodies. This one held promise at face value but fails to live up to the standards of ""Zombieland"" and ""Shaun of the Dead""; 'Shaun' was especially hilarious. What I liked here was the dead-pan sensibility of Bill Murray's character, the police chief of a fictitious town called Centerville (unless this took place in Virginia, because there IS a Centerville there). But it seemed like the running gag of Deputy Sheriff Ronnie Peterson (Adam Driver) and his repetitious 'going to end badly' mantra did get a little tiresome after a while. Easter eggs abound for those intent on finding them, the characters of Posie Juarez and Zelda Winston were portrayed by actresses who's real names were slightly modified, i.e., Rosie Perez and Tilda Swinton. And if you have to, go back and take a second look at Hermit Bob (Tom Waits), a dead ringer look-a-like for the Cowardly Lion in ""The Wizard of Oz"" but without the lion suit. Overall though, the film tends to lose energy as it goes on, and the transition near the end of the story with Samurai mortician Ms. Winston going Zombie X-Files didn't have any kind of connection to the main plot at all. I expected just a bit more from the undead concept than what the picture offered, but at least it was a kick seeing Bill Murray graduate from a ghost buster to a zombie killer.",negative
"Erstwhile Ghostbuster Bill Murray battles the dead again, only this time it's zombies. Jim Jarmusch turns the genre on its head with ""The Dead Don't Die"", setting the movie up like a B movie (I particularly liked the investigation at the diner). They must've had a lot of fun making this movie. An enjoyable one.",positive
"Seriously?I had such high hopes for this movie. I mean, a zombie horror comedy with a star crammed cast, as this was all that director and writer Jim Jarmusch could muster? This was such a disappointing movie in so many, many ways.First of all, the storyline and the pacing of the movie was just atrocious. The movie was unfathomably slow paced to the point of where boredom was starting to set in and you were really to just hold out a hand and let a zombie chomp down on your flesh.And when the movie finally does pick up pace, which wasn't very much actually, it wasn't much of an improvement. Especially since the storyline and script was essentially non-existing and just rubbish.Sure, the zombie aspect of the movie was good, and it was that which lured me to watch the movie after all, as I am a fan of all things zombie. But this was just way, way too boring. And then suddenly a flying saucer turned up, and people started to talk about a script implying that they were in a movie. I was good and ready to just get up and walk out on ""The Dead Don't Die"" at that point. But I stuck with it to the end, to the boring, prolonged and boring end.The zombie make-up was good, so that at least counted for something, but it wasn't enough to make up for everything else where the movie either lacked, came in short or just didn't even bother to make an effort.Now, the movie does have a very impressive assembly of cast, which includes Bill Murray, Adam Driver, Tom Waits, Chloë Sevigny, Steve Buscemi and Danny Glover.There was a healthy dose of sarcasm in the movie, small bits and pieces that you might not pick up on. But that was actually a nice thing about the movie, such as Adam Driver's character having a Star Destroyer keyring, zombies walking with mobile phones groaning ""wifi"", zombies drinking coffee and groaning ""coffee"", Buscemi's red cap with a slogan that openly mocks Trump's slogan, and odd bits and pieces like that could be found throughout the movie.Sadly ""The Dead Don't Die"" is not a movie that I will be returning to watch a second time, because it was just horribly boring and so slow paced that even the zombies were going ""hey, Jim Jarmusch, you mind picking up the pace?""My rating of ""The Dead Don't Die"" is going to be settling on a very low three out of ten stars. The movie had potential, but it failed in almost every aspect. The comedy in the movie was flaccid and just infantile. The storyline and plot was abysmal. And it was a massive swing and a miss of something that could have been such a glorious thing...The movie was, in lack of better terms, dreadful. And it being a zombie movie makes me cringe just having to admit to saying that about it. But hey, not everything zombiesque is amazing, huh?",negative
"Films like ""The Dead don't Die"" make me feel dumb. And, of course, like every normal person in the world, I don't like it when something or someone makes me feel dumb. Why does it make you feel dumb? Because you can't help thinking that you're missing the point. That you're not seeing what everybody else must be seeing. Why else would so many great actors and actresses want to star in an ordinary horror movie with zombies if it wasn't great? Well, I can assure you, there's nothing wrong with us. Jim Jarmusch probably likes to think that his films are arthouse and that his humor is deadpan, but in reality, it's just a bunch of pretentious drivel.Jarmusch did accomplish one thing, though. It's practically impossible to ruin a zombie movie, but somehow, he managed. Young, inexperienced and amateur film makers put together better zombie movies than Jarmusch does; - at least when it comes to plot and atmosphere. Not in terms of acting performances and budget for special effects, obviously. 90% of ""The Dead don't Die"" is dull and derivative of nearly every single zombie movie ever made previously. The remaining 10% is embarrassing beyond words, with the weakest attempt at ""meta-horror"" I've ever seen (""How do you know it's not going to end well? Because I read the script"") and the totally random fate of Tilda Swinton's character.",negative
"For a zombie film, it is pretty boring. The pace is really slow, and there is very little suspense or thrills. It doesn't have gore to appeal to horror fans; and doesn't have humour to appeal to comedy fans either. In fact, I watched it at double speed and it was just about bearable.",negative
"Imagine what would have happened had zombies invaded Mayberry on ""The Andy Griffith Show,"" and you may be amused by arthouse filmmaker Jim Jarmusch's ""The Dead Don't Die,"" co-starring Bill Murray and Adam Driver as two clueless small-town cops combatting the first contingent of a zombie apocalypse. Lukewarm and lightweight, this R-rated, 104-minute, comedy chiller serves as Jarmusch's homage to late Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, filmmaker George A. Romero. Universally recognized as the godfather of zombie movies, Romero reinvented 'the undead' in 1968, with his black & white, post-modern, masterpiece ""Night of the Living Dead."" Thousands of imitations, sadistic, sincere, and silly, have since ensued. Notable titles include ""Return of the Living Dead"" (1985), ""Shaun of the Dead,"" (2004), ""Zombieland"" (2009), ""Juan of the Dead"" (2011), and ""Train to Busan"" (2016). Indeed, the genre exhibits no signs of dying out. In his largely traditional zombie comedy, Jarmusch sticks to Romero's basic rules, while he tweaks the zombie formula with humor. Every character is eccentric, and most turn into zombies before fadeout. Basically, ""The Dead Don't Die"" is a by-the-numbers rehash of Romero's movies, but Jarmusch concentrates more on message than mayhem. You may ogle every frame of ""The Dead Don't Die"" without fear of screaming in abject terror. Apart from an occasional gut-gnawing moment, Jarmusch doesn't wallow in cheap splatter gore. Indeed, while he has made an anemic horror potboiler, with decapitations galore, he has adopted a tongue-in-cheek nonchalance. Jarmusch does virtually everything to undercut any modicum of either suspense or tension. Zombie movies thrive on social commentary, and Jarmusch exploits that potential as a source of humor. Furthermore, one self-aware character knows how everything will end. Seems he has read a version of the script! Gorehounds will classify ""The Dead Don't Die"" as frivolous because the gore is only ankle deep. Writer & director Jarmusch isn't so much interested in zombies as the people who must contend with them. Zombie attacks constitute the equivalent of domestic supernatural terrorism because these fiends arise from within the system!Predictable from fade-in to fadeout, ""The Dead Don't Die"" qualifies as a dry, deadpan exercise in supernatural horror. Jarmusch treats us to a charming depiction of the kind of small-town America immortalized by illustrator Norman Rockwell in his vintage ""Saturday Evening Post"" cover art for 50 years. Nobody could be any more conventional than Chief Cliff Robertson (Bill Murray of ""Ghostbusters"") and Officer Ronnie Peterson (Adam Driver of ""Logan Lucky"") of the local constabulary. They are comparable to Sheriff Andy Taylor and Deputy Barney Fife on ""The Andy Griffith show"" (1960-1968). Friendly, personable, and sympathetic describes them. They don't behave like gung-ho, Rambo types. Everything is down to earth in Centerville until the dead arise and storm the township in droves. Eventually, around 54 minutes into the action, Cliff asks Ronnie for advice about how to kill a zombie.Jarmusch does a solid job of establishing the small-town setting of Centerville, Pop. 738, advertising itself on its Welcome Sign as ""a real nice place."" No sooner has the film unfolded than some trifling things trouble Cliff and Ronnie. Cliff argues it should be dark at 8:20 pm, yet the overhead sun is still ablaze. Meanwhile, after his wristwatch inexplicably stops ticking, Ronnie observes: ""Yeah, something weird's going on."" Later, Ronnie displays his cynicism, ""This isn't going to end well, Cliff."" Officer Mindy Morrison (Chloë Sevigny of ""Kids"") raises them on their police radio and reports other bizarre events before interference garbles her words. After they lose Mindy's signal, Ronnie brandishes his cell phone. Incredibly, he discovers his freshly charged battery is kaput. When they switch over to regular radio, all they can tune in is Sturgill Simpson crooning his woebegone country ballad ""The Dead Don't Die."" This marks the first time Ronnie realizes he may be more self-aware about what evil the future portends than anybody else.As our protagonists cruise back to the police department, Cliff drives past the Centerville Juvenile Detention Center and later the local diner where Farmer Frank Miller (Steve Buscemi of ""Reservoir Dogs"") and Hank Thompson (Danny Glover of ""Lethal Weapon"") are chatting with their waitress Fern (Eszter Balint of ""The Linguini Incident""). Frank wears a red baseball cap emblazoned with the phrase ""Keep America White Again."" Fern listens to the radio while newscasters blame polar fracking for the Earth being knocked off its axis. They attribute all ills and evils, including the dead rising from graves, to the shift in the Earth's axis.When the first zombies appear about 30 minutes into the movie, they munch on both Fern and the diner's cleaning lady. The day after the discovery of the bodies, Cliff and Ronnie ponder the crime. Ronnie contends zombies rather than wild animals feasted on the unfortunate women. Predictably, Cliff is flabbergasted by the outlandish idea of zombies. Eventually, as the zombie numbers multiply, the social order collapses around our heroes. Three juveniles (Taliyah Whitaker, Jahi Di'Allo Winston, and Maya Delmont) escape from the Centerville Juvenile Detention facility and dodge the undead. Like crazy Hermit Bob (Tom Waits of ""Seven Psychopaths"") who eluded Cliff and Ronnie in the film's first scene, the juvenile trio escape inevitable death at the hands of the cannibalistic zombie horde. At one point, Officer Mindy spots her Granny, sentiment overwhelms her, and she plunges into the ravenous pack of flesh eaters. Cliff still cannot believe his eyes. At fadeout, Ronnie and he find themselves surrounded completely by legions of the undead. Ironically, most of these people were their friends before they became zombies. The oddball character who steals the show is Tilda Swinton's Scottish undertaker Zelda Winston. Winston worships Buddha and wields a wicked katana. She slashes her weight in zombies before she vanishes aboard a saucer-shaped spaceship. Bill Murray and Adam Driver headline a sterling celebrity cast that cannot salvage this insipid zombie saga that skewers its horror with humor. Altogether, ""The Dead Don't Die"" is tame by zombie movie standards.",negative
"I guess I get that this was supposed to be a satire of a zombie outbreak. But even for that it's dull and boring. The pace of the movie is sluggish, there's too much time spent on trivial conversations, the fourth wall breaks aren't very funny, there's no plot to speak of, and the ending is weird. the whole thing was just a let down.About the only thing I enjoyed was the theme song.",negative
"THE DEAD DON'T DIE (2019 **1/2 Bill Murray, Adam Driver, Chloe Sevigny, Tilda Swinton, Steve Buscemi, Danny Glover, Tom Waits, Caleb Landry Jones, RZA, Larry Fessenden, Rosie Perez, Carol Kane, Iggy Pop, Sara Driver, Selena Gomez, Esztter Balint, Rosal Colon. Indie filmmaker Jim Jarmusch gets in touch with his inner George A. Romero in this funky yet somewhat disappointing zombie comedy about a small-town facing end of the world changes - the earth is off its axis and the dead are returning to life with predictable tropes embedded and underscored (Driver's deadpan police officer's refrain of ""This won't end well"" and his well-known use of horror lore are key throughout the carnage involved). While I can see why the director (who also wrote the Saltine-dry screenplay) attempts to shake things up in it final act all I can say is 'um, no you shouldn't have'. Murray's sheriff and Swinton's ethereal funeral director are a hoot, as well as Waits' Greek chorus as the town's hermit, as expected but the rest of the cast is sorely wasted (literally).",negative
"Greetings again from the darkness. Love it or hate it. Sometimes it's not that easy. Sometimes it is. Filmmaker Jim Jarmusch has been making his own brand of videos, shorts, documentaries and features since the 1980's. He has a loyal following of viewers who ""get"" him, and even within those ranks there is debate about which of his projects work and which don't. You know who doesn't care? Jim Jarmusch, that's who. He creates the work he wants to create and works with the actors and crew that he wants to work with ... he's best described as the type who lets the art speak for itself.As we pull into town, the billboard states ""Welcome to Centerville. A real nice place. Population 738"". It's a bland town with a bland name filled with bland people whose bland conversations focus on doughnuts and pie from the town's only diner. The police force totals 3 (seems high for such a small town). Cliff Robertson (Bill Murray) is the veteran police chief, while Ronnie Peterson (Adam Driver) and Mindy Morrison (Chloe Sevigny) are the deputies ... all three are bespectacled.Initial interactions provide a quick lay of the land. Farmer Frank (a loud-mouthed Steve Buscemi) accuses Hermit Bob (Tom Waits) of stealing his chicken. Hermit Bob lives in the woods and doesn't take kindly to accusations. Frank, despite his racist core, is somehow friendly with Hank (Danny Glover), a mild-mannered local who chats it up at the diner. Bobby Wiggins (Caleb Landry Jones) is the town's pop culture guru who runs the gas station/comic book store.Even this law enforcement team recognizes strange things are happening: the sun doesn't set when it should, watches are stopped, and animals are disappearing. We hear news reports that 'polar fracking' has knocked the earth off its axis, coupled with government denials stating jobs are plentiful and profits are up. Obviously this is Jarmusch taking his shots at the environmental policies and focus on the economy of the current administration. Our first zombie attack happens at the diner (of course) and features Sara Driver (Jarmusch's long-time partner) and Iggy Pop (who requires little make-up to be convincing as a zombie). Many more zombies follow.While Murray's Cliff and Mr. Driver's Ronnie maintain their deadpan conversations and reactions, it's Ms. Sevigny's Mindy who is terrified in the face of their nonchalance. Adding color to the mix is Tilda Swinton as Zelda, the samurai sword wielding mortician with a Scottish accent, a flair for make-up and an other-worldly secret. Also appearing are Selena Gomez, Carol Kane, Rosie Perez and RZA.As the opening film at this year's Cannes Film Festival, it's a blend of comedy, fantasy, horror, zombie, and social commentary ... but none of the pieces are particularly effective. It's somehow both wry and mundane, and not meant to be traditionally scary or laugh out loud funny. Jarmusch has delivered such diverse films as PATERSON (2016), ONLY LOVERS LEFT ALIVE (2013), and BROKEN FLOWERS (2005). ""This isn't going to end well"" is a line Driver's Ronnie states a few times, and it's both foreshadowing and self-awareness from the filmmaker. It's his commentary on the state of the world, as well as the movie.Zombie-comedies have been done (SHAUN OF THE DEAD, DAWN OF THE DEAD and many others), and it's usually best to bring something new to a tired genre. Instead, Jarmusch pays tribute to such films as NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, KILL BILL, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, PSYCHO, and STAR WARS. He even tips his cap to Samuel Fuller (gravestone) and George Romero (a 1969 Pontiac LeMans). As if to acknowledge the love-hate factor that goes with his movies, Jarmusch allows Sturgill Simpson's (also appearing as the guitar-zombie) theme song to exemplify such division. Selena's character and Ronnie love the song, while Murray's Cliff can't stand it and flings the disc out of the car window.You are likely wondering if the world needs yet another take on the zombie apocalypse. Of course, the answer is no ... which means in Hollywood, there are countless more zombie apocalypse TV series and movies (numerous sequels) in the works. Jarmusch isn't here to simply add another number to the genre. No, he uses the format to proclaim that our society is soul-dead. He believes we are all stumbling, zombie-like, through life, rattling off our favorite products. He may be right.",negative
"As you may have heard, this movie sets out to be a horror/comedy movie, specifically a spoof of the zombie genre. But with its main intents - to be horrific and funny - it fails extremely badly.I'll start off by saying how the movie goes wrong with its horror side. The movie takes FOREVER for the building zombie apocalypse to reach a point where the characters start to fully realize they have a problem on their hands. I think I had to wait until the halfway point before the problem becomes big enough. And when that point has been reached, there isn't a real feeling of ever-increasing menace or panic - the zombies just move around slowly for the most part, with the human characters taking the situation way too lightly. Also, when there is a scene of direct battling of zombies, it's too soft and unconvincing, made worse that the CGI effects depicting everything from blood to decapitations is pretty unconvincing.Yes, I know that the movie has an (intended) comic side, so that we should not view the zombie attacks with complete seriousness, but the problem is that the comedy is desperately unfunny. It's too deadpan for the most part, and when it gets more jokey, the level of humor is so lazy and unoriginal that even a 12 year old wouldn't find it funny. (A character saying that they already read the script for this movie? Oh, ha ha, very funny!)There are additional problems with the movie, such as characters that seem to serve no purpose (why are the juvenile delinquents given so much screen time when they don't get a definite and proper conclusion or exit?) The only merit I can think of that is in the movie is that writer/director Jim Jarmusch does capture the look and feel of small town America very well, and that I will admit that the movie is never boring despite its problems. But despite not being bored, the failed horror and lame comedy made me deeply regret picking up this movie from my local library. It's easy to see why the theatrical distributor only gave the movie a half-hearted theatrical release.",negative
"This is a difficult one to review because it's full of well known actors from the past and two rock and roll idols so on that part it's a delight to see them perform again. On the other hand the movie is slow, and that will be a turn-off for so many geeks.If you are into zombies I should say try it out because they are in it and they do bite. Never on the gory part but still, it's zombiefied all over. For me it's more about the sarcasm all over this flick. Due that fact it makes it slow.Effects are mediocre and indeed, some actors are just in it for a minute or a bit more but they deliver their parts as it should be done. Agreed on so many reviews of thos one, if you are sleepy due the slowness it is possible that you will fall asleep.Still, no plot at all, nothing explained (maybe the earth itself) and going nowhere it is one for the geeks itself. Gore 1/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 2/5 Story 2/5 Comedy 0/5",negative
"It is clear that everyone had fun making this and it is enjoyable to watch. Just once or twice, perhaps because it is so laconic and laid back, the movie seems to stop. There is, for instance, a scene where the police car is besieged and the scene is stunning to begin with, then a little over long and then in suspension with nothing happening. Overall though this is fun with plenty of cinematic references and in jokes. Tilda Swinton is as good as I remember seeing her for a long time, Scottish accent attempt not withstanding. Bill Murray seems below par and indeed his timing lapses become slightly embarrassing. Tom Waits, however, who I would not have recognised is fantastic. The direction is fine with some lovely cinematography, particularly in the woods and of various shop and diner fronts (and interiors).",positive
"A good director, a grand cast of well known actors with a propensity to play in smart indie films, zombies. This should have been a recipe for success, but the result was underwhelming. People are just doing their own thing as an ultimate critique of society: a bunch of people doing their own thing. The acting was as good as possible, considering the simplistic cardboard characters, the humor was mostly situational and not a lot, but there was no actual story. It was like a Facebook funny post stretched to one hour and forty five minutes.Bottom line: a severe disappointment, something that feels written by a lockdown depressive watching on the window but unable to participate.",negative
"Somethin' weird's goin' on. Ronnie (Adam Driver)Zombie movies don't die. Except that Jim Jarmusch's The Dead Don't Die is even more lasting than the most intrepid zombie. The slow, ironic pace and the dry responses of lead cops Cliff (Bill Murray) and Ronnie guarantee chuckles every few seconds and a leisurely stroll through a ghoulish genre.While undoubtedly some audiences will not like the slow pace, I found it well suited to Jarmusch's jaded view of slacker humanity, giving us time to savor the rich satire about acquisitive humans returning from the dead for their ""stuff"" like chardonnay and coffee.Indeed, if there is any reason for zombie lore, it has to be lampooning their selfish, materialistic natures that feed of each other to keep alive to ransack stores for more ""stuff.""As to be expected, this kind of off-beat satire has its weaknesses, especially in character development where lead characters have no back story, and promising secondary roles like Steve Buscemi's grumpy farmer have no room to strut their sardonic stuff. What we do get is Buscemi giving his patented acerbic misanthropy in small doses.Other minor characters lend texture and humor. The nerdy owner of a weapons and comics store, Bobby Wiggins (Caleb Landry Jones), is spot on for an eccentric denizen perfectly attuned to the bizarre activities. Zen samurai Zelda (Tilda Swinton) acts like she stepped right out of Uma Thurman's castrating Kill Bill and into the same only with heads. She has a wickedly good swing.Cannibalism even in comic form never really interests me, yet Jarmusch succeeds getting me interested in the lead characters and the thematic and figurative underpinnings of the zombie cineverse. For the hard-core zombie lovers, the theme has to be: ""This is not going to end well."" (Ronnie) For the rest of us, the bible can parse some of the meaning: ""And in those days people will seek death and will not find it. They will long to die, but death will flee from them."" Revelation 9:6 ESV",positive
"The Dead Don't Die is one independent film that doesn't have much of a plot, yet it entertains and thrills with one liners and dark humor as it's a little parody of George Romero flicks like ""Night of the Living Dead,"" and ""Creepshow"" as these zombies will not die and they rise from the grave and eat flesh! Set in a rural town called Centerville the graveyard comes alive after the town is plagued with loss of cell phone service, and it seems like night and day is mixed up as the time of day seems strange. Plus pets and animals start to vanish plus some blood and gore is added with plenty of laughs. And the lineup features some film favorites like Bill Murray, Adam Driver, Chloe Sevigny, Steve Buscemi, and Carol Kane. Overall nothing special or fantastic it's just a film that has fun with one liners and thinking that the end of the world might end with an army of zombies.",positive
"This is one of the most garbage movies i've ever seen. i could tell it was going to be bad right away but tried to give it a chance. this movie is complete nothingness. there is not one redeeming quality. there is zip, zilch, zero, nothing, no nada. (1 viewing 10/17/19)",negative
"Jim Jarmusch claims he made ""The Dead Don't Die"" because he wanted to make an entertainment that the general public could relate to and simply have fun watching. Showing it at Cannes, of course, also suggests he had one eye on the critics too, though they have been less than enthusiastic, hoping perhaps he might emulate his vampire masterpiece ""Only Lovers Left Alive"" and yes, if you are expecting a retread of that you will be disappointed. However, if you go to ""The Dead Don't Die"" wanting nothing more than a good, gory and very funny slice of schlock-horror you will love it as much as I did. Of course, Jarmusch being Jarmusch can't content himself with a simple send-up; he has to go down the post-modern route of referencing the fact that it's only a film and a Jim Jarmusch film at that, so we have characters talking about reading the script and that the much played title song is, indeed, the film's theme song but these are the weakest aspects of Jarmusch's comedy. Otherwise this is a full-frontal assault on the funny-bone..You can ignore what passes for a plot, suffice to say ""Night of the Living Dead"" is a good jumping off point, and relish a cast of Jarmusch regulars, (Adam Driver, Bill Murray, Tilda Swinton, Iggy Pop, Tom Waits etc), having a ball. Driver and Swinton may have the best of it, showing that even in a pastiche like this they still have the acting chops to carry it off. It's not flawless; the build-up to this zombie apocalypse takes too long and a few of the gags are repeated long past their sell-by date but I still laughed longer and harder at this than at any other movie I've seen this year and if it's minor Jarmusch, it still shows that even minor Jarmusch is often so much better than many of his peers.",positive
"I know that ""Toy Story"" is a beloved franchise...I get that. But at the same time, it's a movie that's spawned three sequels AND countless shorts. Despite a complete lack of originality, however, folks still love the films and the Academy keeps awarding Pixar with Oscars for the movies. As for me, I've had enough and would really love to see the studio focus on something new and original.The story is about a new toy, 'Forky' the spork--a toy that Bonnie made at kindergarten out of some trash. Forky is trash and doesn't get the concept of being a toy....and constantly is trying to throw himself away despite Woody's best efforts to keep him with Bonnie. In the process, Woody ends up getting separated from Bonnie at Great Basin National Park (on the Nevada/Utah border). Can he find his way back to Bonnie? And, what about Forky?Although the film lacks originality, I hate to admit that it is gorgeous....with about the nicest looking CGI I can recall having seen. It is lovely to look at and the characters are more fluid and lovely to look at than ever before. Perhaps this is why it got an Oscar....it certainly wasn't for any other conceivable reason. After all, it's yet another film where the toys try to find their way back home....just like in all the other films. Overall, an enjoyable film that is nice to watch and with a few enjoyable moments...but nothing more. It's essentially ""Toy Story"", ""Toy Story 2"" and ""Toy Story 3"" all over again.By the way, like other Toy Story movies, the creepy characters in this one are the Vincent marionettes. And, they are mega-creepy nightmare fuel.",negative
"Am a big fan of Pixar and have been for two decades or so. Have not loved everything they've done, 'Cars 2 and 3' and 'The Good Dinosaur' (to a lesser extent too 'The Incredibles 2') disappointed though certainly didn't dislike any of them. Their best work though are masterpieces, for me the previous three 'Toy Story' films, 'Inside Out' and 'Coco' fit this distinction as do most of their short films.Was in two minds when hearing that there was going to be a fourth 'Toy Story' film. Am somebody who would see the latest Pixar film, regardless of critical reception, at the earliest opportunity, not for nostalgia but for being an animation fan and having appreciation for high quality stuff. But it is very understandable that people are saying that they questioned the point of this being made and that 'Toy Story 3' was a perfect end, that was the very first reaction felt when first hearing of it. Those who weren't bowled over by this shouldn't be crucified for feeling underwhelmed and feeling that it was unnecessary.My aforementioned initial reaction was still not completely quashed finally seeing 'Toy Story 4' for myself. Thought actually it was still a good film, namely on its own, but if quickly getting any comparisons out of the way it is quite a bit below the quality of the first three 'Toy Story' films and as far as Pixar films go it's towards the bottom in my opinion. Which is actually not a bad thing, it says a lot about how brilliant much of their work is. A lot of great qualities, but the disappointment from some is understandable.The story is a slight one and can feel over-stretched, especially when in the latter antique store scenes. This is the only 'Toy Story' film where the pacing was flawed in my view. It is a shame too that most of the original gang are underused and their material not being much of note.Buzz didn't have the same spark and it was like those involved had not remembered what made him so memorable. The ending is proof that the ending of the third film was the perfect note for the 'Toy Story' films to go out on, because this one is one of the most anti-climactic and unsatisfying-in-outcome for any recently seen film (for me that is).However, the animation is superb and the component that actually improved with each film, although that in the first is ground-breaking. Was transfixed by the vibrant colours and rich background and character details, toys and humans. The antique store and fairground settings are vividly done. It was great to have Randy Newman back on board again, not easy to imagine a 'Toy Story' film without him and the magic hasn't been lost. Reprising ""You've Got a Friend in Me"" was a genius move and that was what stuck out most memorably in this particular regard.Enough of the dialogue is witty and sharp, 'Toy Story 4' is far from laugh a minute but it is a long way from humourless. The best laughs coming from Ducky and Bunny, Duke Caboom was fun too. 'Toy Story 4' is not without soul either, found Gabby to be one of the Pixar's most empathetic and interesting supporting characters of their 2010s output (a ""villainous"" character that is not really a villain). Forky is likeable and his chemistry with Woody, on top form, is charming. It was great to see more of Bo Peep and her personality more developed, a mix of sympathetic and sassy. Her chemistry with Woody, which one really feels, is one of the film's biggest pleasures.Voice acting is terrific, Tom Hanks, Annie Potts, Christina Hendricks and Tony Hale standing out. Didn't recognise Keanu Reeves either.Overall, good film but not a great one. 7/10",positive
"TOY STORY 4 is an addition to the original trilogy that really shouldn't have been made. I thought part three was pushing it a bit, a late-stage addition that somehow tied up things nicely with a real sense of nostalgia and time moving on, whereas this feels more like a cynical cash-grab. There are flashbacks and reunions in order to get the main characters in familiar settings, but the rest feels very tired; once again there are separations and rescues and quirky supporting characters. Some of the new voice actors are amusing enough (hello, Keanu Reeves) but otherwise this offers nothing new whatsoever - aside from improved animation.",negative
"Woody sneaks into Bonnie's backpack to watch out for her on her first day of kindergarten. He helps her create Forky out of the trash. The family goes on a road trip. Forky escapes and Woody goes in pursuit. Along the way, they are reunited with Bo Peep and her sheep while facing off against Gabby Gabby.This is surprisingly emotional. There are surprising turns at the end. I'm uncertain about the future prospects of the franchise but I'm also a little excited about a reunion. It would be fine if this is the end but that would be a shame. This is a great franchise. If there is one that deserves to continue, there is non better than this. As for Forky, I expected a wilder voice. His introduction is amazing. There are a few terrific journeys along the way.",positive
"As an older adult I thought the third offering in this series was so moving. It also had a finality to it that made me feel sad and satisfied. The fourth one must have been an effort to rake in some big bucks on reputation. I found it to be the usual masterful special effects of Pixar, but it lacked emotion and story development. While I'm sure a young audience would like it, I was just left a bit cold. One criticism that others have offered, and to which I agree, is the lack of use of the cast of toy characters. Even Buzz gets short shrift. Why pay these really cool actors to do voice-overs and then have so little for them to do. I know that little girl is cute, but that only goes so far. She was the positive concluding representation of the Third film. It just didn't need to be made.",negative
"Okay, here we have ""Toy Story 4"" and the title is somewhat self-explanatory almost as this is the fourth installment to the famous and super-successful animated film franchise and this one was released now in 2019, almost a quarter of a century later than it all started. And also almost a decade after the third Toy Story movie which many (inclusing myself) considered perfect closure really, but as always with almost every very commercially successful film series they keep coming up with new additions. Still, this is not meant as a negative criticism because if they turn out as nice as this one here, then there are no regrets from my side they made it. And honestly when can you ever not trust Pixar and Disney. Very rare. So now the director of these 100 minutes here is Josh Cooley a voice actor on Up and Oscar-nominated for his really witty and funny ""Inside Out"" screenplay and after some short film directorial efforts they leave the fate of the newest part of the franchise in his hands and they made no mistake doing so. As for the script, Cooley is also involved, but you also find the name of Pixar Legend John Lasseter and surprisingly also the one of Parks&Rec actress Rashida Jones who I really did not expect here, but it shows how much talent this series has to offer beyond Pratt and Poehler and also some of the others for sure. But back to Toy Story now. I thought it was a fun watch, even if I must say I am still a bit baffled how these toys manage to keep their very agile life in secret still and have done so for years, decades really because lets be honest here sometimes they can be pretty clumsy. Or lets take one specific example, namely when Jessie gives back the sheriff star early on to Woody. Now had Bonnie a better memory, then she would have been surprised what's going on, but this is not what small children remember I suppose. Okay, so much for the realism component. Lets not dissect the film from that perspective now, but at least take a look about all the many things gone right here.The first and definitely among the most important aspects is that they got all the voice actors back from the older movies. This includes Hanks obviously, but also Tim Allen who was like the alpha male comedian/actor when it all started (look at his programs, or don't) just in case you wonder why he is doing Buzz Lightyear. But also many of the new characters they introduced like the Canadian stunt motobike rider (Reeves) or Ducky and Bunny (Key&Peele) are worth it and breathe new great life into this not dusty franchise at all. Often these kind of films stand and fall also with the antagonists and how memorable they are and in this department it is a success too as we have a little doll who wants a part of Woody, but it really isn't one Woody needs too much and it helps her in fulfilling (what she thinks is) her dream, so it is all good and she is not scary at all. On the contrary, they are helping her with her dream too in the end. And her aides are these seemingly robot-like gentlemen who are honestly slightly scary also with their faces, but not in a really bad way honestly like they are really just following orders. Still, there are these moments when they are turning their heads and one occasion even 180° around, which reminded me a bit of The Exorcist, even if I had no idea if it was meant this way, but it is one of the things that grown-ups will recognize and kids probably won't. Now if grown-ups even watch this film. In my showing I was the only one in the audience altogether, which was nice, but definitely not what the film deserves. Still it's been in theaters for a while already at this point, so I guess early on more people watched it and it was a commercial success again too.Another character who deserves a mention is Forky (Tony Hale, Veep), who was among the best and funniest things of the entire film when he was introduced with his constant attempts to make it to the bin, a real case of lost identity and he has to come to terms first of all with being an actual toy and not garbage, even if it is never really too much on a more serious note about that. The comedy completely prevails with this little fella and how long they really kept his story line going even at the center of the film showed how classy the script is. Luckily for him, at the end, he even finds a partner, which will make things easier for him. So yes as good as the film was in terms of drama and emotion as always with Pixar and Disney really, comedy is mostly key here. I really adored the ""has a child"" running gag used on several occasions and it really doesn't get old. And there are many other funny moments. You will recognize them when you see them. The old and new characters who all have a lot of attention to detail make them work without a doubt and will have you in stitches at times. Just one more example when Buzz finds out about his inner voice and how he reacts to it was really great. Now I like Woody and cowboy( toy)s are cool, but by now he feels more like a vehicle to boost all the other more special characters around him, even if at the very center of it all he is still in the middle of the plot too also when it comes to making crucial life decisions. Maybe this did not do too much for me because I have never been a really big Bo Peep fan, so it is at least partially subjective, but makes kinda sense that the sheepkeeper ends up with the cowboy. I'm just more of a Jessie fan, I can't deny it. But still the more serious stuff does not come short either. Like when Woody says bye to all his friends at the end (now that will be a challenge to reunite them for a fifth film, which will certainly come), it is pretty touching no denying. And what else touched me was Gabby Gabby's fate because you could really see how the girl she wanted to be her child would not love her as much as she wanted it to happen, but when she finds somebody else who was as lost as herself, it is just the sweetest moment ever. You can also make real life parallels about love and attraction here. Still very subjective, you will maybe be moved by other moments more. But you will be no matter by what. Okay finally a few words on some of the audio. Randy Newman is back with his easily identifiable voice to provide some new songs, but we also hear some of his old works. And I watched the German dub, so I cannot say anything about the English-language actors this time, but the dub was fine, even if Bully Herbig was the only truly known name. or maybe because of that because all the supporting characters were voiced by experienced voice actors and not big name German actors. The only other one I knew was Kavanian, not a surprise he is in here next to Herbig with their common past. So this was a really good film, three stars out of five and if I gave half stars maybe 3.5 even because at its peak it is certainly 4 out of 5. Again a definite contender for Best Animated Feature Film at the Oscars with inclusions maybe for screenplay or song too. We will see if Frozen 2 can be a worthy contender in the key category. But it doesn't matter anyway, even if I am glad they are pushing each other to new heights. No losers in/for this movie except those grown-ups who still refuse seeing the newest so so good animated movies. Their loss. A definite thumbs-up for Toy Story 4!",positive
"Pixar has set a high bar for other films for many years, and has also done the same for itself. This is particularly evident within the Toy Story franchise, with such a high bar to try to hit or top, the challenge was really there for Toy Story 4, particularly because the ending of Toy Story 3 had seemed so perfect and so touching. The premise for Toy Story 4 seems to be more about Woody himself, finding his way and learning how to be more than just 'someone's'. This is less engaging as a theme, but does still work well enough to have some emotional weight to it, even if it doesn't get close to the impact of the previous films.Of course this doesn't mean that the film is somehow poor, but just that it doesn't meet the very high standards associated with the franchise. It is still a very good film indeed - I watched with people spreading across a 65 year or so spread, and all enjoyed it for its comedy, action, and solid plotting. There were some 'modern' elements in there that I thought clunky within it, but this may have been me more than the film. Otherwise it is a fun adventure which serves Woody well, even if it is not quite a match for the films before it.",positive
"I am glad Disney didn't go the easy route and make the same film four times. Our toys end up with Bonnie who loves a toy spork. When the not-so-astute fork becomes separated at a carnival, Woody to the rescue. The film gets slightly dark as an evil Chatty Cathy doll wants Woody's voice box and has some creepy Jerry Mahoney dolls as henchmen.One of the questions raised by the film is who still plays with valuable old toys? Aren't they in antique stores or on display? And with Disney's acquisition of the rights to Star Wars, I would have expected things to go in a different direction. Nothing like a bittersweet story of children growing up and the end to childhood.",positive
"So a fourth Toy Story movie? Even the teaser trailer made fun of this, because we all knew (got told), that there would be no more. Now what do we make of this? You could bury your head in the sand and act like a friend of mine, who in a way denies this movie exists and really presses that if it was called something else he might have liked it.Now if you can be a bigger person or just able to distinguish and get un-stuck (if you were in the first place that is): there is a really good movie here. Pixar almost always gets it right and you kind of know they would not mess with this or rather just do something for the sake of it. So while the third put a really good lid on it (full circle, great ending, whatever you want to say about it), this finds a way to give us a new story ... and a new satisfying (?) ending ... that depends on the viewer of course.Great animation, great voice work, good new and old new characters, although there is an emphasis on some of them and your fave may not get as much screentime as you'd like. Still all good - no pun intended.",positive
"For this older viewer, this entry in the Toy Story series didn't seem to capture the same magic as the first three films. It's not bad as a stand alone film, but when you compare it to what's gone before, there's an element missing that makes it more of an average animated picture. There aren't as many sight gags and it doesn't carry the same sense of nostalgia that ""Toy Story 2"" had, for example. What it does have going for it is the skillful animation and colorful palette, and the new character 'Forky' added a whimsical vibe to the cast of characters. Most of the other returning toys though are sadly underused; Buzz Lightyear for example only makes a handful of appearances and isn't instrumental to the story line. Duke Caboom was also a new entertaining presence, while the pair of ventriloquist dummies reminded me of a couple 'Twilight Zone' episode characters back in the day which they resembled so much. But even though my review here is kind of lukewarm, I'd still encourage families to view it together as a fun time at the theater. That's the way I did it, and that's what makes it all worthwhile.",positive
"It was inevitable that the series was going to have a fourth - and probably final - installment. It's fun, if not a masterpiece. New cast members include Christina Hendricks, Keegan-Michael Key, Jordan Peele, Keanu Reeves and Patricia Arquette.But here's what caught my attention: the references to ""The Shining"". The original reference in the franchise was the carpet in Sid's house, which matched the Overlook's carpet (which Stanley Kubrick intended as a representation of the hotel's repetition of events). The obvious reference here is the phonograph playing ""Midnight, the Stars and You"", which got played at the 1920s ball attended by Jack Nicholson's character. Then there's the typewriter, 237, and some others. I'd like to see the ""Toy Story"" franchise crossed with ""The Shining"" (presumably Woody is married to Bo, and Jessie is their daughter; Woody gets a job as caretaker of a hotel, but Buzz's ghost tells him to ""correct"" them). Yeah, I have too much time on my hands.Anyway, fun for its runtime. It was high time that Mel Brooks and Carl Reiner provided voices in an animated feature together.",positive
"The original three Disney Pixar films are fantastic, there were people that were sceptical that it should have remained a trilogy. The cast and crew claim this will be the final film in the series, and it went on to break the world record for biggest box-office opening for an animated movie. Basically, nine years ago, when Woody (Tom Hanks) and the gang were still with Andy, there is a rescue operation to save R.C. from being washed away in a drain. While the toys save the remote-controlled car, they are unable to stop Bo Peep (Annie Potts) and her sheep being given away by Andy's sister Molly. Woody tries to convince Bo Peep to escape and stay, but she reassures him that she will be fine, and he knows he cannot go with her, because Andy still needs him, so they bid each other farewell. Two years after Andy gave his toys away to Bonnie (Madeleine McGraw), Woody and the gang have settled and are happy in their new life. But Woody has been neglecting Woody recently, and he observes that she is overwhelmed about starting kindergarten. Woody sneaks into Bonnie's backpack, hoping he will help her cope, he watches her become nervous and almost cry during an arts and crafts session. Woody covertly sneaks materials, including pipe cleaners and googly eyes, along with a spork, Bonnie turns the spork into a handmade toy she names ""Forky"". Forky (Tony Hale) comes to life in Bonnie's backpack, shocking Woody, he introduces him to the other toys back at home. But Forky experiences an existential crisis, he believes himself to be trash and continually tries to throw himself in the garbage, and Woody repeatedly retrieves him. Bonnie and her parents go on a road trip, Forky throws himself out of the window, forcing Woody to follow him out. While walking to return to Bonnie, Woody explains why he makes Bonnie happy, he accidentally mentions Andy during this. Forky becomes enthusiastic about being Bonnie's toy, and they eventually reach the RV park where Bonnie's family are staying. But Woody spots Bo Peep's lamp in the window of an antique store, he sneaks inside, with Forky following, hoping to find Bo inside. Woody and Forky encounter a doll named Gabby Gabby (Christina Hendricks) and her creepy ventriloquist's dummies, the Bensons. Gabby offers to take them to Bo, but her true plan is to obtain Woody's voice box, her own is broken and no child will purchase her. Woody and Forky, but they are separated, Woody is surprised to be reunited with Bo Peep at the playground, while Forky is captured by Gabby. Bo is now living a free lifestyle as a ""lost"" toy, but she agrees to help Woody save Forky and get back to Bonnie. Meanwhile, Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) searches for Woody on his own. In an earlier conversation, Woody claimed he had an ""inner voice"", Buzz mistakes him for meaning his voice box, so Buzz often presses his buttons, activating his own voice box phrases to use as guidance. Buzz accidentally causes himself to become a carnival prize at the fairground taking place between the RV park and the antique store. He escapes with plush toys Ducky (Keegan-Michael Key) and Bunny (Jordan Peele), and they meet up with Woody and Bo. Along with pocket toy cop Giggle McDimples (Ally Maki) (inspired by Polly Pocket) and Canadian stuntman toy Duke Caboom (Keanu Reeves) (a spoof of Evel Knievel), they try but again fail to rescue Forky. Woody tries to convince them to try again, but Bo is not willing for them to risk their lives again, she and the others leave when Woody indirectly insults her. Woody encounters Gabby Gabby again, who tells him of her longing to belong to the store owner's granddaughter, Harmony (Lila Sage Bromley.) Having been told about Andy by Forky, she convinces Woody to give her his voice box in exchange for Forky. Woody and Forky enter Bonnie's backpack, which she left at the store when she and the parents popped in. As Bonnie is retrieving it, Forky and Woody watch Harmony reject Gabby. Woody sends Forky back alone, with a message for Buzz to meet them at the carnival's carousel, while he comforts Gabby and invites her to become Bonnie's toy. While Bo meets with the gang and they head for the carnival, with Trixie (Kristen Schaal) impersonating the RV's GPS and others manipulating the RV controls. Gabby sees a crying girl lost in the carnival, Woody convinces her to approach the child, to find her and help her, the little girl is given confidence to approach a security guard and find her parents, the others are happy Gabby has found a new owner. At the carousel, Woody and Bo share a bittersweet goodbye. Buzz realises that Woody feels torn, and perhaps lost without Andy, he tells him that Bonnie will be okay without him. Woody decides to stay with Bo and gives his sheriff badge to Jessie (Joan Cusack). The RV departs, and Bonnie's toys leave with her. Woody, Bo, Giggle, Duke, Ducky, and Bunny continue to travel with the carnival, and help children to win prize toys. On her first day of first grade, Bonnie makes another new toy: a female plastic knife, to whom Forky eagerly introduces himself. Also starring Jay Hernandez as Bonnie's Dad, Lori Alan as Bonnie's Mom, Bonnie Hunt as Dolly, Emily Davis as Billy / Goat / Gruff, Wallace Shawn as Rex, John Ratzenberger as Hamm, Blake Clark as Slinky Dog, June Squibb as Margaret the Store Owner, Carl Weathers as Combat Carls, Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head (archive sound), Jeff Garlin as Buttercup, Estelle Harris as Mrs. Potato Head, Laurie Metcalf as Andy's Mom, Mel Brooks as Melephant Brooks, Alan Oppenheimer as Old Timer, Betty White as Bitey White, Carl Reiner (Rob's father) as Carl Reineroceros, Bill Hader as Axel the Carnie, Patricia Arquette as Harmony's Mom, and Timothy Dalton as Mr. Pricklepants. The characters we have grown to love for the last twenty-four years all remain appealing, the new characters are likeable, the voice cast to bring them to life are great, it makes you laugh, and it tugs at the heart strings at the right moments. You could argue that Bo Peep's personality has changed significantly, there is that little something missing that causes it to be not quite as magical as the previous movies, and the ending is a little questionable, it is probably a good idea this will be truly the last film made, but I guess it concludes Woody's story, all in all, it is an enjoyable computer-animated comedy adventure. It won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film, and it was nominated for Best Original Song for ""I Can't Let You Throw Yourself Away"" by Randy Newman, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Animated Featured Film, and the BAFTA Children's Award for Feature Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Animated. Very good!",positive
"My wife and I watched this at home on BluRay from our local library.There isn't much to say about these types of animated stories of toys that come to life when people aren't watching. They are fantasy and just meant for entertainment. Is this one entertaining? Yes, it is.The ""storyline"" described here on its IMDb main page aptly sums up what the movie is about. There are a number of clever jokes to add to the entertainment.I just want to comment on one of the voice actors, Keanu Reeves as Duke Caboom, an Evel Knievel type of motorcyclist daredevil. During his movie career some have criticized Reeves for his lack of dynamic personality, but his voicing of this character should erase all that doubt. He turns out to be my favorite in this cast of voice actors.",positive
"This film tells the story of Woody and his friends going on an adventure outside the house.The story is engaging and adventurous, which are elements which captures viewers' hearts. There are a lot of food for thought for adults as well, especially on the theme of loneliness and desire for social attachments. However, I find Woody's persistent stubbornness rather irritating. Overall, it is a nice way to spend 90 minutes.",positive
"Like lots of people I was very sceptical about there being a 'Toy Story 4', after part 3 appeared to wrap up the franchise so beautifully.However, there is a lot to like about this 4th instalment, with it feeling like a lovely epilogue to what has gone before.While perhaps not without it's slower moments, and Buzz/Jessie are a little underused, there is enough quality storytelling and heart to justify the film, and the ending is right up there with the incinerator moment in TS3.I hope Pixar celebrate a job well done by now closing the toy box lid on Woody,Buzz and the gang, as this would be a fitting ending.",positive
"Those Expecting ""Toy Story 4"" to be ""Stretching"" it were Greeted with a Definitely Not ""Out of Slink"" Movie that does what ""Family"" Films do at a Minimum...Entertain.Pixar was the First to Fully Computer Animate a Feature Film with the First ""Toy Story"" (1995) and to Say that They Changed a Century Old Genre (Animation) is a Vast Understatement.Although ""Pixar"" has been the ""King"" of these Things, it has Coasted at Times and could be Accused of Less than Stellar ""Sequelitist"".But then there are Events like ""The Incredibles (2004), ""Monsters Inc."" (2001), and some other Great Stuff and All is Forgiven.The most Frequent and LOUDEST Complaints (Bitching) about this Movie seems to be the Accusation of SJW Regarding Feminist Pandering.Moving the Female Characters Up Front at the Expense of the Male Characters Personas becoming Diminutive. Most Prominently ""Woody"" and ""Buzz"".Duly Noted...Moving On.This is a Warm, Adventure Filled Film with New Characters Added to the Team with Fresh Ideas and Focus.Entertainment as Good as it Gets These Days and ""Pixar"" has Nothing to Apologize for.It's a Hit with Critics and Fans and Anyone who Cannot Find This Anything but Fantastic, Uplifting, Enlightening, Animated Entertainment...Is in Need of a Friend.",positive
" . . . where to find her? asks TOY STORY 4. Since smooching ""Jessie"" would be like kissing his sister, Woody must tie a bow on it. Bo not only knows baseball and football, but she also runs a mean zip line. After suffering the ordeal of a forcible amputation (at the hands of a doll NOT named ""Lorena!""), can a maimed Woody fare better than ""Jake"" did as twilight falls in THE SUN ALSO RISES? Or will TOY STORY 5 take a tragic turn, with a homeless Woody swearing off Bo, as unable to perform when it counts as ""Papa Hemingway's"" frustrated Mr. Barnes? Pixar's animated features are notorious for their dark undercurrents, and TOY STORY 4 is no deviation from this pattern. What the scissors of ""Gabby's"" henchmen taketh, Ms. Peep's crook will prove powerless to return. In a Perfect World, Bo and Woody might live happily ever after, raising a flock of little peeps to follow in their father's footsteps. Bo would NOT yearn for what Woody lacked, and her eyes would NEVER wander after stray Canadians. Isn't it pretty to think so?",positive

Fun and clever still the ensemble of talent is overwhelming (and sadly many are short-shrifted as well) but the theme of universal love of children and their playthings still pulls at the heart-strings.

"The Toy Story franchise's ability to make one quality movie after another is really special. This is the fourth over a span of 24 years and they have not lost a step.So, we know with every new Toy Story there's a new toy or toys-usually multiple toys because there are the good and the bad. We also know that Woody is going to be heavily mixed up in whatever is going on. Part four is no different.It picks up where part three left off with Andy bequeathing his toys to little Bonnie. Bonnie plays with the toys like nobody's business then there is a shift. She goes to kindergarten. There she makes a toy out of a spork and little ""Forky"" (Tony Hale), as he's called, takes the gang on a new unplanned adventure.Toy Story 4 had everything I wanted to see: a good story, creative action from the toys, and laughs. Thanks to Key and Peele playing Ducky and Bunny I got laughs that I don't think I've ever gotten from a Toy Story before.The laughs were really an added bonus. The story was wonderful and of all the toys, Bo Peep (Annie Potts) stole the show. She showed toys in a new role and it was great.Toy Story could go another 24 years and I think it would continue to be stellar. So, instead of the presidential chant of ""FOUR MORE YEARS!"" let's start the chant of ""TWENTY-FOUR MORE YEARS!""",positive
"Greetings again from the darkness. Yes, it's another instant classic from Pixar. No, we shouldn't be surprised. Their track record is beyond compare. But I can't help it. How the heck do they do it time after time, movie after movie? We have known (most of) the characters for 25 years now, and this fourth entry seems every bit as fresh and creative as the first one. We like these characters, and it doesn't matter that they are animated. We laugh and cry and worry about them as if they are our friends.Tom Hanks returns as our favorite cowboy Woody (yes, he still has a snake in his boot), and Tim Allen is back as Buzz Lightyear (still unable to grasp that he's not a real space ranger). Also returning is Annie Potts as Bo Peep, now a strong, independent ""lost"" toy with excellent survival and scavenging skills. Some new toys and voices inject real pizazz to the adventures. Christina Hendricks charms as Gabby Gabby, a doll quite desperate for her own kid; Keanu Reeves shines as Duke Caboom, a showboating motorcycle stunt rider who may not be as daring as his big talk; and Tony Hale turns Forky into a lovable little cockeyed spork-toy. Also bringing fun and a new comedic element are the hilarious team of Jordan Peele and Keegan-Michael Key as Bunny and Ducky, respectively.The opening sequence takes place 9 years ago, and we see how Bo Peep became separated from the others, and how the toys transitioned to Bonnie and how Bonnie transitioned to Kindergarten, and how Forky transitioned from trash to toy. And fear not, the old favorite toys are all here: Wallace Shawn as Rex, Joan Cusack as Jessie (I expected a bigger role for her), Timothy Dalton as Mr. Pricklepants, Pixar stalwart John Ratzenberger as Hamm, Blake Clark as Slinky Dog, and courtesy of archival recordings, two posthumous appearances by Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, and Bud Luckey as Chuckles the Clown.With his first feature film as director, Josh Cooley follows up his screenplay for the brilliant INSIDE OUT with a touching and superbly funny film. The screenplay comes from Andrew Stanton (2 time Oscar winner, FINDING NEMO, WALL-E) and Stephany Folsom, while the original story credits are many, including John Lasseter in his last project with Pixar. Even though the film is Rated G, it should be noted that it's a pretty complex story for youngsters, and the Charlie McCarthy dolls are kind of terrifying - at least to me and Forky. TOY STORY (1995), TOY STORY 2 (1998), TOY STORY 3 (2010) get the send-off they deserve, so ""move your plush"" and go see it! Randy Newman is back with a new song, as well as the familiar melody and lyrics from his Oscar nominated ""You've Got a Friend in Me"" ... a friend indeed.",positive
"After having told a friend about how much I enjoyed seeing Shazam!, (2019-also reviewed) at the Manchester IMAX in The Printworks (the second biggest screen in Europe) he expressed interest in going at some point. I was happily caught by surprised,when he invited me to join him and his family in seeing Toy Story 4 at The Printworks today.View on the film:Opening the toy box after 9 years, PIXAR display the remarkable progression of CGI from the opening scene of photo-realistic rain and the shiny reflections on plastic toys. Soaring on a dynamic atmosphere, the director Josh Cooley plays with giving shots the appearance of long ""one take"" panning shots, highlighting the bursting with colour character designs (which includes evil dummies!) and the pristine animation being filled with a real attention to detail of each background/setting, (from an antiques shop to inside a RV) being packed with interesting objects and visual gags in every corner.Whilst Buzz Lightyear (who has a very funny ""inner voice"" running gag) moving to a supporting role is notable, the writers unexpectedly make the near decade gap from the third evaporate, by the arrival of Forky taking the themes of friendship,growing up,belonging and existing which have run across all the films,are gathered together into bringing closure to the toys which they have given their owners. One of the few animated films to not have a all-out baddie, the writers unbox new toys and smoothly fit them in with the classic range,thanks to the mix of hilarious set-pieces, (such as Woody trying to stop Forky seeing himself as ""trash"") and striking warmth, (such as avoiding from making Gabby Gabby a mere boo-hiss villain) making this toy one which can be played to infinity and beyond.",positive
"Toy Story 3 wrapped things up so nicely that this movie can't quite shake the outlier feel; but even I have to admit to getting wrapped up while watching this. It looks fantastic, the cast is uniformly excellent (consistent with the franchise) and the story beats hit home when the need to. I appreciate the maturity in Woody's and Bo Peep's arcs and absolutely loved the addition of Keanu Reeves and Key & Peele.""Toy Story 4"" may not be a game-changer, but it's a worthy addition.",positive
"ALITA: BATTLE ANGEL certainly isn't a great film, but it's better than I'd been expecting and it's considerably better than the likes of VALERIAN and GHOST IN THE SHELL. Robert Rodriguez is an old hand at making comic book style stories and this is certainly a visually impressive movie, with a fun plot involving extremely realistic and humanised cyborgs. It screams cyberpunk and BLADE RUNNER, with plenty of cool action sequences taking your mind off the shallowness of it all and the overloard of CGI on frequent occasions. The cast are also a lot better than you'd expect for this kind of film, and the main character looks great.",positive
"It's 300 years after The Fall, a devastating global war. Zalem survives as the sole floating city. Beneath it lies the slums of Iron City where many of the world's surviving population has gathered. Only products from the factories go up to Zalem. No one goes up although rumors persist. Dr. Dyson Ido (Christoph Waltz) runs a clinic repairing robotic limbs for the poor. He scavenges cyborg parts from Zalem's scraps. He repairs it and names her Alita (Rosa Salazar) after his dead daughter. She has no memories. She is befriended by Hugo who introduces her to the popular sport of Motorball. Dyson's ex-wife Dr. Chiren (Jennifer Connelly) is working for crime lord Vector (Mahershala Ali). Girls are being murdered for their robotic parts.Surprisingly, I really like the start of the movie. I even like Alita's doll eyes. The city could use a bit more grime. I don't particularly like Motorball. It reminds me of a futuristic Rollerball which leads me more towards a B-movie vibe. I thought the dead girls could be a good dark serial killer mystery but it's simply an excuse to introduce some bad guys. The story gets further and further into things that isn't very interesting. I love the first cyborg battle in the alley but it gets a bit boring after that. I still like the movie but it's a bit boring as it keeps going. I figured it would elevate with a visit to Zalem but it's not that either. I'm a little disappointed after a good start.",negative
"It remains, for me, a mystery the source of seduction of this film. Sure, the story, the fights, the determination and vulnerability of the lead character. But it is more. Something becoming, scene by scene, the answer to deep expectations of the viewer. The story is simple and many pieces of it are so familiar. But it remains, from the beginning to the last scene, just fascinating. No explanations. Only a great and solid show.",positive
"Essentially a movie version of the nine-volume manga, this movie was in development for more than a decade by James Camern before he handed over the script to Robert Rodriguez. With the actors enhanced with CGI -- particularly Rosa Salazar as Alita, with the enormous eyes of Japanese anime -- it's hard to view this as anything but an animated picture. Rodriguez, with the largest budget of his career, spends it wisely and gets the money on the screen. Assisted by fine actors like Christopher Waltz and Jennifer Connelly, the story is half Pinocchio, half Conan the Barbarian, as directed by Cecil B. Demille.It's not the sort of movie that I search out, but given the enormous talent involved, I had to take a look. I have to admit that for this sort of movie, it seems very well done.",positive
"In 2563, three hundred years after the war ""The Fall"", the mysterious scientist Dr. Dyson Ido (Christoph Waltz) finds part of a female cyborg in a junkyard and brings to his laboratory. He finds that her human brain is amnestic but intact and gives the name of his deceased daughter Alita (Rosa Salazar) to the cyborg. Alita meets on the street Dr. Ido´s ex-wife Chiren (Jennifer Connelly), who is also a scientist that works to the powerful Zapan (Ed Skrein), and befriends the young Hugo (Keean Johnson), who brings cyborg´s parts to Dr. Ido, and learns that both dream on moving to the floating city of Zalem. Hugo teaches Alita how to play Motorball and she learns that the champion of the Motorball Tournament moves to Zalem. Soon Alita discovers that Dr. Ido is a hunter warrior and after finding her cyborg body in a crashed spaceship, she decides to become also a hunter warrior but Dr. Ido refuses to replace her body. Who was Alita and what is the secret of the cyborg body found by Alita?""Alita: Battle Angel"" is a sci-fi adventure with great screenplay, cast and special effects. The Japanese anime of an amnestic cyborg that finds who she was is engaging to any sci-fi fan. Dr. Ido is a sort of cyborg Dr. Frankenstein and the direction of Robert Rodriguez is entertaining as usual. The conclusion indicates that there will be a sequel. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Alita: Anjo de Combate"" (""Alita: Battle Angel"")",positive
"A big budget adaptation of a Japanese manga. Alita: Battle Angel has some great action courtesy of director Robert Rodriguez who makes good use of a bigger budget.The hands of producer James Cameron are everywhere in the visual effects. It looks like a Cameron movie. Unfortunately his typewriter is visible in the screenplay he co-wrote. A clunky story made worse because he wants to use this movie to set up the sequels.Set 300 years in the future with a nice makeover of the Fox logo. After a destructive global war, there is a wonderful floating city up in the sky called Zalem.The film is set in the slums of the city beneath. Iron City where it is a wretched dog eat dog world and people dream of getting into Zalem somehow. However no one goes up unless they win a champions league supreme Motorball competition once every few years.Dr Dyson Ido (Christoph Waltz) finds some cyborg parts and rebuilds her calling her Alita (Rosa Salazar) after his dead daughter. Ido is also a Hunter-Warrior looking for the scum who killed his disabled daughter some years ago. He also seems to know more about what exactly Zalem is as does his ex-wife Dr Chiren (Jennifer Connelly) who is desperate to get back up there by hook or by crook.Ido is worried about Alita who looks and frustratingly acts like an innocent trusting young girl and her brain has no memories of who she was. Iron City is a violent world where women are being killed for body parts.Alita excels as a warrior and in the game of Motorball. She comes to the attention of Vector (Mahershala Ali) the criminal who runs this city. One of his scavenger's Hugo befriends Alita.It is wonderful to look at, the action soon becomes derivative and repetitive though. The film also shows its influences too easily. Blade Runner, Tron: Legacy, Rollerball, Robocop.The screenplay lacks a killer punch. Like some of the baddies, doomed to get up and repeat their mistakes.",negative
"So while James Cameron is really very busy with Avatar 2-5 (I know? Wasn't it supposed to be a trilogy?), he does find time to produce things like this. But we have Robert Rodriguez at the helm. A director who is always juggling between kid friendly themes and themes that are aimed at adults. And he mostly succeeds in his efforts.In this case he gets a playground like never before - at least that's how it feels. Even bigger than the one he had with Sin City and he had quite a budget there too. Here we get a movie from a source material a lot of people seemed to have been curious about. Now I never had heard about Alita, but the movie is really something when it comes to Science Fiction. The PG-13 boundaries have also been moved it feels at times. At least we get quite a lot of action, but then again most involve something non-human (even if it is human like).If you like Fantasy and Action you will be more than entertained, even if the story is quite predictable. It did not translate quite into the box office, so I'm not sure there will be more movies ... but we'll take what we get",negative
"This really isn't a criticism, but ""Alita: Battle Angel"" is primarily a movie made for teens and young adults, so for me it had limited appeal. I know Japanese manga comics and anime have found increased popularity over the years, and this appeared to be anime brought into the physical world so to speak. That's particularly true with the character of Alita (Rosa Salazar), who actually does look like an animated version of a super-hero type warrior. Her doll eyes in particular were distracting for this viewer, who kept wondering why she was made to look like a robot. Alita has the fighting skills of Panzer Kunst, a lost combat art for machine bodies in the twenty fourth century. More specifically, she's been restored from an Iron City scrap pile by Dr. Dyson Ido (Christoph Waltz), and given the body of an URM (United Repunlics of Mars) berserker, following a brief run with the synthetic body of Ido's own daughter who died. There's plenty of fight action and while it takes some time for Alita to recover her past memories, it seemed like she was able to defeat an army of formidable techno-warriors much too easily given her size and youth. A good portion of the story utilizes the concept of the 1975 film ""Rollerball"", here renamed Motorball for the Iron City crowd. By handily defeating the Second League of Champions in her first Motorball contest, the film makers set up an expected sequel in which she graduates to a First League battle to become champion, which goes without saying, as it's a foregone conclusion that Alita would prevail in any future movie.",negative
"James Cameron (The Terminator, Aliens, Titanic, Avatar) was originally meant to be director, he stayed as producer, along with Jon Landau, but he passed on directing to Robert Rodriguez (From Dusk Till Dawn, Spy Kids, Sin City, Sin City: A Dame to Kill For), based on the Manga comic series. Basically in the 2563, the Earth has been left devastated following a catastrophic war known as ""The Fall"". Cyborg scientist Dr. Dyson Ido (Christoph Waltz) is scouting the junkyard metropolis of Iron City, when he discovers a disembodied female cyborg head with a fully functioning and intact human brain. Ido rebuilds the cyborg (Rosa Salazar), who wakes up with no memory of who she is or where she came from, he names her ""Alita"" after his deceased daughter. Whilst exploring the city, Alita befriends Hugo (Keean Johnson), who dreams of moving to the wealthy sky city of Zalem. Hugo introduces her to the competitive sport of Motorball, a battle royale race wherein cyborgs fight to the death. One night, Alita follows Ido, she discovers he is a Hunter-Warrior, and they encounter three cyborg assassins led by Grewishka (Jackie Earle Haley). When Ido is injured, Alita instinctively attacks the cyborgs, killing two of them and severely damaging Grewishka, who retreats underground. Despite Alita rediscovering her skill in the ancient martial art of ""Panzer Kunst"", Ido discourages her from becoming a Hunter-Warrior. The next day, Alita finds a Berserker body from an old downed ship outside the city, she brings it home, but Ido refuses to install her in the body, fearing the consequences of her heart's full compatibility with it. Alita is fed up with Ido and registers as a Hunter-Warrior, then she and Hugo enter the Kansas Bar to ask other Hunter-Warriors in helping her take down Grewishka, but Grewishka is not on the wanted list, they refuse. Suddenly, an upgraded Grewishka storms into the bar and challenges Alita to a rematch, revealing he has been sent by his boss, Nova (Edward Norton), to destroy her. Alita demonstrates great courage and combat skills, but her body is sliced up by Grewishka's bladed fingers, he is blinded and forced to retreat by Ido, Hugo, and another Hunter-Warrior. Ido transplants Alita in the Berserker body, which automatically interfaces with her system. Alita enters a Motorball tryout race as a means to send Hugo, who she has fallen in love with, to Zalem. Ido discovers that all the other contestants in the game are Hunter-Warriors and wanted cyborgs hired by Vector (Mahershala Ali), an entrepreneur working under Nova, to kill her. He warns Alita as the race begins, she is able to destroy many of the contestants with her superior skills. Meanwhile, Hugo is hunted by and framed by cyborg bounty hunter Zapan (Ed Skrein) for murdering a cyborg, he calls Alita for help and she leaves the Motorball race to rescue him. Zapan arrives and reveals that Hugo has been attacking cyborgs and stealing their parts for Vector for use in his Motorball games. Zapan knows that Alita is in love with Hugo, he mortally wounds hiNm and tells Alita that Hunter-Warrior law dictates that she must either kill Hugo or let Zapan finish him off. Hugo is saved by Ido's ex-wife Chiren (Jennifer Connelly), also a master cyborg engineer, with his head being attached to Alita's heart, while Zapan has part of his face sliced off. Ido transplants Hugo's head onto a cyborg body, Alita is told that Hugo was given false belief that his actions would eventually buy his way into Zalem, and Ido confirms that this lie was fabricated by Vector, and that citizens of Iron City cannot enter Zalem unless they become Motorball champion. Alita decides to confront Vector, who is being mind-controlled by Nova, a powerful Zalem scientist. Nova talks to Alita through Vector, reveals that and then orders Grewishka to kill her, they battle, and she finally kills him, then stabs Vector, telling Nova he made the mistake of underestimating her. Ido tells Alita that Hugo has run away, she finds him desperately attempting to climb a factory tube towards Zalem. Alita pleads with Hugo to return with her, but a massive spiked defence ring set off by Nova shreds Hugo's body and throws him into the air, Alita is unable to prevent Hugo from falling to his death, but he thanks her for changing him before letting go. Months later, Alita becomes a star athlete of the Motorball tournament, as the crowd cheers, she points her sword towards Zalem while Nova watches her from above. Also starring Eiza González as Nyssiana, Michelle Rodriguez as Gelda, Casper Van Dien as Amok, Jeff Fahey as McTeague, Lana Condor as Koyomi, Jorge Lendeborg Jr. as Tanji, Die Another Day's Rick Yune as Master Clive Lee and Derek Mears as Romo. Salazar looks like a figure from a Margaret Keane painting, because of her big eyes, but is good as the female cyborg who slowly becomes a tough fighter, Waltz is likeable as the scientist who helps her to develop, Connelly is alright, and Ali is reasonable as the villain. You cannot deny the spectacle and special effects are amazing, the dystopian world is impressive, and the main plot of the lead character trying to rediscover herself is fine, but it is too keen to get into the fast-paced sequences, with the Motorball sequences and a lot of robotic body dismemberment, it goes off-track often and gets confusing at times, it is almost more style over substance, an average futuristic science-fiction fantasy action. Okay!",negative
"This film is set in the year 2563, three hundred years after 'The Fall'. The action takes place in Iron City; a dystopian location in the shadow of the wealthy, floating city of Zalem. One day, while scouring the city dump for spare parts, Dr Dyson Ido discovers the remains of a female living cyborg. He then attaches her to the body he had made for his disabled daughter who was killed before she could use it. She awakens with no memories of who she is so he calls her Alita, after his late daughter. He then shows her the world; cautioning her about some of its dangers. She later befriends Hugo, who introduces her to the sport of motorball... a dangerous sport where cyborgs compete for the chance to be allowed to move to Zalem. She also discovers Dr Ido is a 'Hunter-Warrior', a bounty hunter, when he is cornered by a trio of killers she instinctively helps him; using martial arts skills that were believed lost... clearly Alita is somebody special. She soon becomes known to the city's shady authorities and they want her power source. She will have to fight to save herself, close she cares for and for the justice she believes in.The early parts of this film may seem a little slow but they serve to introduce the protagonists and the world they inhabit. Once the action begins it is exciting. Much of the fighting is between cyborgs but some of it still manages to be a little shocking given the films rating. There is a good sense of mystery about Alita's character and we gradually learn more about her throughout the film as she learns about herself. The cast does a solid job; Rosa Salazar in particular impresses in the role of Alita. The special effects are great; Alita may be CG but apart from her large eyes one might think she was real. Similarly most of the action looks real even in situations it obviously couldn't be. The only slight weakness was the sport of Motorball; the way it was presented, with commentary, reminded me of pod-racing from 'The Phantom Menace' crossed with 'Rollerball'... a minor quibble though. The ending is clearly designed to set things up for a sequel or sequels... I certainly hope we get more as I really enjoyed the story so far and was left wanting more. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of the genre.",positive
"My wife and I watched this at home on BluRay from our public library. It is a collaboration of James Cameron as writer and producer, plus Robert Rodriguez as director. As such it has a beautiful look and great action sequences.It is set in the far future, the 2500s, wars between advanced civilizations on Mars and Earth have changed the world, big cities are in ruins, and cyborgs roam the streets looking for bounty. A doctor who specializes in repairing damaged cyborgs hunts for spare parts in the large dumping ground. He comes across part of the upper body of a girl, his scanner shows her brain is still alive.He brings the remnants back to his place, attaches appropriate limbs and other body parts and facial repairs, and she wakes up again, we eventually learn she is about 300 years old. She is played by Rosa Salazar via motion capture and computer generated images, the doctor gives her the name Alita.The character and story are based on Japanese graphic novels popular beginning in the 1990s, Alita has the face of an angel but is battle trained, thus the title ""Alita: Battle Angel.""Ultimately she is drawn to use her cunning and fighting skills to try to defeat the most evil man, but the 2-hour movie ends right at the point where she is prepared to go into his lair, the ancient city in the sky. Clearly setting it up for a sequel.Which really is my only disappointment, viewers are somewhat cheated by such a lack of closure of the main story. I will certainly watch the second movie when it comes out on disc but still long today for a better conclusion.On a positive note, there is a great set of ""extras"" on the BD, the genesis of the project, the techniques used to make the movie, and much much more. In fact I now wish I had watched some of the extras before seeing the movie which is a 2-hour product of many years of work by thousands of people.",positive
"Initially I had some aversion towards this project when I first came to learn about it. Now, I loved the animated Manga ""Battle Angel Alita"" when I was a teenager, so I was somewhat split on how to feel about a live action movie rendered upon that. And with it being a non-Japanese version just added to that doubt.But still, I decided to sit down and watch the 2019 ""Alita: Battle Angel"" movie from director Robert Rodriguez anyway.And luckily so, because this movie was phenomenal. Director Robert Rodriguez put all my doubt about the project to shame. And this movie was a thrill ride from beginning to end. Actually, ""Alita: Battle Angel"" can be summarized with just a single word: wow.The storyline told in this 2019 live action movie was quite good. It was compelling and interesting, and writers James Cameron and Laeta Kalogridis managed to create something that grips the audience right away and doesn't let you go before the movie ends.The characters in the movie were quite nice, nicely detailed in personalities and equally nicely brought to life on the screen by a cast of wonderfully talented actors and actresses. Rosa Salazar, playing Alita, was spot on. She really carried the character so well and also carried the movie phenomenally. And with the help of the likes of Christoph Waltz, Jennifer Connelly and Mahershala Ali you are in for a grand movie. It was cool, but not surprising to see him in a Robert Rodriguez production, to see Jeff Fahey in the movie and his character was really cool. Just a shame he didn't have more on-screen time.Initially, I had a little aversion to the way Alita looked. But it quickly grows on you and becomes a nice character trait to her.Now, the CGI used in ""Alita: Battle Angel"" was nothing short of amazing. And it had to be spectacular for an ambitious movie such as this. Glad to see that the CGI team really came through here and made the movie so impressive and realistic to look at.I was genuinely entertained from start to end by what director Robert Rodriguez presented in the 2019 movie ""Alita: Battle Angel"". And I can warmly recommend that you take the time to sit down and watch it.",positive
"When I saw the first trailer for this movie, I thought, ""No one but me is going to go see this movie."" But you know, it's the most successful movie Robert Rodriguez ever released. And I guess it was a success - the film grossed $85.7 million domestically and $319.1 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $404.9 million.That's good, right?Well, to break even against marketing costs, the movie had to make around $500 million, so it either lost $53 million or barely broke even. Dude, I'm sweating making my minimum payments on my credit cards and these dudes are farting around with figures where $53 million - the amount of money that Mario Bava could have made Danger: Diabolik thirteen times.PS: I had to do the math for what that movie cost in Italian lira versus U.S. dollars, then do the inflation calculation from 1968 to today. I laugh, because I once said that I would never use math.So yeah - how did a movie based on Japanese manga artist Yukito Kishiro's 1990s series Gunnm and the 1993 original video animation adaptation Battle Angel ever make it to U.S. screens?Guillermo del Toro told James Cameron about it - way back before Avatar. The film sat for years before Cameron asked Robert Rodriguez to condense and combine his 186-page screenplay as well as 600 pages of notes into a shooting script. That work led to Rodriguez getting the directing job and hey - we have a movie.2563 and we're already three hundred years after the Great War nearly killed everyone on Earth. That's when cyborg scientist and part-time bounty hunter Dr. Dyson Ido (Christoph Waltz) finds a disembodied female cyborg in the scrapyard of Iron City. He names her Alita after his dead daughter and saves her human brain.Alita is in love with the city and meets all manner of people, from Ido's ex-wife Dr. Chiren (Jennifer Connelly) and a kid named Hugo who introduces her to the sport of this new world, Motorball.However, Hugo has a big secret: he really works for Vector (Mahershala Ali, who was astounding in the third season of True Detective), the man who runs Iron City and Motorball.Alita also learns her father figure's secret - he's a bounty hunter - and when she trails him one night, she saves him from a gang of cyborg killers. One of them, Grewishka (Jackie Earle Haley), hounds our heroine for the rest of the movie. Alita dreams of bigger things and her past life where she was a Berserker, one of the soldiers of the enemy United Republics of Mars.You know, maybe reading the manga would have made this all much easier.Alita goes off and registers herself as a Hunter-Warrior, but is unable to rally any of the other hunters to help her stop Grewishka, who is working for Nova (Ed Norton). Alita's body is nearly destroyed by the killing machine before Ido, Hogo and dogmaster McTeague (Jeff Fahey!) save her.Now in a new Berserker body, Alita soon takes over the Motorball league, but loses the love of her life due to the machinations of Nova and his soldiers. The film ends with Alita as a Motorball star, promising that she will someday get her revenge.You know all that money I mentioned at the top? It didn't really matter in the long run. That's because this ended up being the last Fox movie ever made, as Disney purchased the studio, moving us closer to the corporate-controlled world that this movie portrays.I enjoyed this, but I have no idea how anyone else would react to a movie based on a manga from the 90's made for a worldwide audience. It's one of those movies where it cost so much that there's no way that anyone would see any money from it. But man, it looks really cool, right?",positive
"The story is good, the pace is fast, the visuals are very good. And Alita's eyes are really big! I actually enjoyed this way more than I thought I would. I thought the ending was too abrupt - I wish the film was longer.",positive
"Sin City director Robert Rodriguez's manga-inspired, post-apocalyptic, science fiction, cyberpunk, origin epic ""Alita: Battle Angel"" is a spectacular, but predictable fantasy extravaganza set in the dystopian future of the 26th century. The action unfolds in the year 2563, after an Armageddon referred to as ""The Fall,"" otherwise known as ""The Great War,"" has devastated Earth. The eponymous heroine is a formidable cyborg warrioress, abandoned to rust on a scrap heap, who fears nobody and nothing. Miraculously, Dr. Dyson Ido (Christoph Waltz of ""Inglourious Basterds""), a bespectacled cyberphysician, rescues her remains, and then revives this 300-year old combatant. Like Rodriguez's previous, mature-themed, actioneers ""El Mariachi"" (1992), ""Desperado"" (1995), ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" (1996), ""The Faculty"" (1998), ""Once Upon A Time in Mexico"" (2003), ""Planet Terror"" (2007), ""Machete"" (2010), ""Machete Kills"" (2013), and ""Sin City: A Dame to Kill For"" (2014), ""Alita: Battle Angel"" qualifies as a triumph of style over substance. Each of these B-movies is the equivalent of cinematic junk food. Fast-paced, outlandish, but diverting nonsense, these nine guilty pleasures are ideal if you find yourself plagued by insomnia. Rarely does Rodriquez fail to deliver. The combat scenes in ""Alita"" rival those in the Keanu Reeves' classic ""The Matrix."" James Cameron, who has helmed masterpieces, such as ""The Terminator,"" ""Aliens,"" ""The Abyss,"" ""Titanic,"" and ""Avatar,"" co-scripted the screenplay with ""Terminator Genisys"" scribe Laeta Kalogridis. Reportedly, Cameron bought the rights to manga writer Yukito Kishiro's ""Battle Angel Alita"" (1990) and then sought to direct it himself. The success of ""Avatar"" and the pressure of directing four ""Avatar"" sequels forced Cameron to shelve Kishiro's manga heroine. Happily, Rodriquez stepped in and took the helm, with Cameron doing double-duty as writer & producer. Manga fans will be pleased to learn ""Alita"" preserves a substantial part of Kishiro's characters and conflict. Of course, Rodriquez has toned down the horrific gore from the source material to avoid an R-rating. You won't see Grewishka sucking the brains out of his enemies as he did in the manga. After he resurrects Alita, Ido equips her with a cyborg body which he had designed initially for his crippled but now departed daughter. Alita awakens the next day and admires the lovely designs that adorn her new body. Ido tells her she is 300-years old, and he explains she was a battle warrior like none other in the universe. As in the Jason Bourne thrillers, Alita remembers nothing from her past, until she engages in combat. Nevertheless, our heroine doesn't know what to make of these fleeting memories, especially when she performs the ancient, martial arts, fighting technique ""Panzer Kunst."" Once she shifts into full-combat mode, Alita is not to be toyed with, despite her petite stature. In some respects, Alita's repeated clashes with an obnoxious, overbearing, part-human/part-cyborg colossus, Grewishka (Jackie Earl Haley of ""Watchmen""), imitate the Biblical story of David & Goliath. Alita never backs down from any fight. Later, when she is reduced to little more than a head and torso with one arm, she refuses to capitulate to Grewishka. By far, Alita ranks as the most pugnacious female warrior cyborg you'll ever see in any movie. She can make fools of her opponents, such is her acrobatic skills and timing. At one point, Grewishka acquires a weapon which transforms each finger of his mechanical right hand into flying chains with grappling hooks that can be deployed at supersonic speed against an unsuspecting opponent. Indeed, Grewishka is one of Alita's chief adversaries. After Alita acquires her new set of limbs and legs, she learns more about Iron City, Zalem, and Motorball. A war has decimated Earth, and only one gigantic, airborne, saucer-shaped city out of ten has survived, and it is called Zalem. The Earth itself resembles a sprawling wasteland, and Zalem has built a factory and farms on the land beneath it to supply and nourish its hopelessly affluent citizens. The multi-lingual metropolis of Iron City lies beneath the shadow of Zalem, and the refugees of this holocaust have gathered from all parts of the Earth to settle beneath it to provide for the floating city. Gigantic tubes that anchor the flying city to the terrain are designed to transport cargo to Zalem. Literally, Zalem constitutes a heaven on Earth. Naturally, everybody dreams of ascending to Zalem, but immigration is strictly forbidden. Zalem has combat measures to repel any attempts to breach it. In this respect, ""Alita: Battle Angel"" resembles the Matt Damon & Jodie Foster sci-fi saga ""Elysium"" (2013) where disenfranchised minorities struggled to enter the city orbiting Planet Earth to take advantage of its life-saving medical treatments. Not only does ""Alita"" allude to ""Elysium,"" but it also features a sport reminiscent of ""Rollerball"" (1975) starring James Caan as well as the 2002 remake with Chris Klein. In both versions of ""Rollerball,"" everything revolved around a futuristic sport called Rollerball, a souped-up version of roller derby, with life and death outcomes which mimicked the mass hysteria that galvanized ancient Roman audiences during their bloodthirsty gladiatorial tournaments. Supposedly, only the greatest player in the murderous sport of Motorball has a chance to ascend to Zalem. The harrowing Motorball scenes are among some of the most exhilarating, with a wide variety of cyborgs careening around recklessly as if they were competing in a demolition derby. These cyborgs resemble refugees from a ""Transformers"" escapade. Not only does Alita tangle with the minions of a tyrant, Vector (Mahershala Ali of ""Green Book""), who supervises Motorball betting, but also with an omniscient overlord, Nova (Edward Norton), who manipulates Vector from Zalem. Altogether, watching the above-average ""Alita: Battle Angel"" is a lot of fun. When Rodriquez isn't dazzling us with the staggering, CGI-laden, gymnastic battles, he trots out an impressive cast, including Jennifer Connelly, Ed Skrein, Rick Yune, Jeff Fahey, and Jai Courtney, with Michelle Rodriguez performing a voice-over in Alita's memories. Produced for a mind-blowing $170 million, ""Alita: Battle Angel"" concludes on a promising cliffhanger. Whether or not a sequel ensues will depend entirely on its box office statistics.",positive
". . . ""This film is based upon 660 years of science fiction flicks you've already seen--only the names have been changed, since ""Steamboat Willie's"" creators are STILL bribing the U.S. Congress to keep extending American copyrights back from 2563 to 1925."" You can perform a simple test to double-check these facts for yourself. No matter how much you ""zoom"" while watching ALITA: BATTLE ANGEL frame-by-frame, you will not be able to detect a single clue that ""Mickey Mouse,"" ""Donald Duck,"" ""Goofy,"" or even ""Pluto"" have been able to make a mad dash break-out for Freedom into the Public Domain, despite having plotted to do so for the better part of seven centuries!

After a couple of very WALL-E-styled derivative hours, viewers learn that the joke's on them: BATTLE ANGEL's set-up for sequels hints that it may take as many as three or four more flicks for ALITA to finally get off the ground!

"Alita(Salazar, handling every single of the countless facets of the role perfectly) is found and repaired by Dr. Ido(Waltz, a father figure with a secret), making her one of the dozens, perhaps hundreds, of cyborgs that he fixes. She has no memory of her past. However, when she gets into violent confrontations, she gets flashbacks that help her figure it out. Almost immediately(to the point where it's silly), she falls in love with Hugo(Johnson, charming yet covering up something), and he with her, as the two yearn for something better than the paltry existence in the harsh environment of Iron City. Their romance is a major element in this. And like with most of those, while I thought it worked well, clearly many do not agree. And I do understand why. Ultimately, your mileage may vary.Let's tackle the big one: is the titular character an example of the uncanny valley? It was a gamble to make her resemble the manga version so closely, most of the excellent redesigns going at least a little further. I would argue that it works. It's not as though her face is the one thing that reveals we're not looking at a human actor: almost no part of her entire body is flesh and blood. Do note that a number of other characters in this have proportions that are much further from humanoid. I suppose that's the point others are making - she does look a lot like, but not quite exactly like, a human. It will work for some, and not for others. The CGI is photo-realistic, and the world building is incredible. You completely believe that this is a place that people live and work; not a series of sets. That it's massively populated; we're not just seeing a lot of extras. The 3D, too, is an upgrade from Avatar, adding depth and atmosphere, rather than being cheesy and calling attention to itself. The action starts out very good and gets better with each scene. This has uneven pacing, and suffers from trying to fit in every single thing from the first two volumes of the original work. Reading them I didn't get the sense that Yukito Kishiro intended for them to be translated directly into a massive Hollywood blockbuster. While they're compelling, they don't fit that format too well. The ending reveals that without at least one sequel we simply will not get a conclusion to the story this sets up. I think this would have fared better if it had gone with some of the later books, such as the ""tuned agent"" storyline, which, I would say, lends itself better to this sort of thing, and could have closure.There is a moderate amount of strong, bloody, brutal violence in this(since they're part robot, it gets away with it with a PG-13), albeit it does do away with the most horrifying material(which would have landed this an NC-17, easily) from the graphic novels. I recommend this to any fan of speculative science fiction. 8/10",positive
"Right away the most eye-popping thing about this movie is the CGI. This was some next level graphics. The CGI for Alita (meaning the girl not the movie) was astounding. We're not talking about a few-seconds clip or even one scene, we're talking about her being the feature piece in just about every scene.Going beyond the graphics (because it's easy to be distracted by them), the movie was decent. I'm not familiar with the manga Alita and whereas this movie made me a bit more familiar there were still lingering questions. Also, at times, the script was elementary. That may have been by design because you got the sense that Alita was like a child emotionally and developmentally so some of her statements and actions were supposed to be juvenile. It made her character more puritan and of course more vulnerable.Alita can shape into a nice franchise but it will definitely rest upon the awe factor of the graphics.",positive
"Despite having heard about the art form for years,I've never read a Manga. Being aware of the title since reading about adaptation plans in UK film magazine Empire during the early 2000's,I last month picked up the first excellent volume of Yukito Kishiro's epic as my Manga intro. Having been intrigued by the trailers, I got set after reading the Manga to catch a glimpse of Alita.View on the film:Taking a similar path to the one he took for Sin City (2005) in paying respect to the original roots, director Robert Rodriguez & The Matrix (1999) cinematographer Bill Pope spectacularly frame the thrilling action sequences directly from the pages of Yukito Kishiro's drawings, soaring in ultra-stylised arc shots spinning on each of Alita's take downs.Bringing light into Alita's Manga eyes from the scrapheap her head is pulled from in the last major Fox release before it was sold to Disney,Rodriguez streams a crunchy Cyberpunk atmosphere, which welds the smooth CGI that eyes Alita between live action and Anime, with gliding whip-pans over the decayed post-apocalyptic landscape where Alita lays waste to the cyborg gladiators.A project he has been wanting to make since 1995, the screenplay by co-writers James Cameron & Laeta Kalogridis powers up when using Yukito Kishiro's Manga as the spine,thanks to it allowing space for Alita to grow from the hard-knocked scrapheap, into a tough as nails battle warrior, (a major recurring theme in Cameron's works) whilst also charging wonderfully strange Cyberpunk sparks (such as serial killer robots and a head transplant.)While a part of the original Manga, Cameron's move to expand Alita's romance with Hugo to be more in tune with his star-crossed lovers on the Titanic (1997) sinks from making the emotional punch it attempts to, partly from the disengaged turn by Keean Johnson as Hugo,and also due to it eating up time which could be used to explore the more quirky Cyberpunk elements in Alita's battles.Holding her mechanical heart out to Hugo, Rosa Salazar gives a fantastic performance as Alita, bringing a doe-eyed warmth to Alita's captivating Manga eyes breaking away from her machine origins with emotive self-discovery, which Salazar balances with growing brutal skills to take down all the baddies in the city,as the battle angel rises.",positive
"Abandoned Alita is found in the scrapyard of Iron City by Ido, a cyber-doctor who takes the unconscious cyborg to his clinic.When Alita awakens, she has no memory of who she is, nor does she have any recognition of the world shes in.As Alita learns to navigate her new life and the treacherous streets of Iron City, Ido tries to shield her from her mysterious past.Much like Ghost In The Shell, Alita suffers from all style over substance. Yes, the film is amazing to look at, and there are some truly awe-inspiring set pieces in the film, but much like the desolate place Ido finds the titular character, the rest of the film is hollow and devoid of any soul.Why Rodriguez directed this is baffling. There is none of the directors style to this film, it's just an empty vessel that feel like it has been shredded within an inch of its artificial life to make the running time slimmer.Waltz is wonderful as usual, but his character seems to empathetic to be a hunter at night, and more interesting characters like Skrien or even Fahey, are pushed to set piece heaven and given very little to do.If you have to see this, find the biggest screen, in 3D and lower your expectations, because this is nothing more than a charmless set up for a franchise that will never happen.I'm pretty sure that this will be one of the biggest disasters of the year, but it won't affect the director or Cameron, because it's just too dull and boring for anyone to care about it's existence.A shame, as it had so much potential to be a beautiful world builder.And then Ed Norton turns up as a glam rocker come the end.I only hope this doesn't Norbit Ali's Best Supporting actor nomination",negative
"The visually wonderful story has an emotional if at times silly plot that makes it better than Transformers. The novel thing about this movie is what they did to make the human face of Rosa Salazar cartoon like.Be warned of violence - lots of beheadings and dismemberments - even though it's robots it's still violent. James Cameron's Terminator like cyborg human mix with emotion does help engage the viewer because after a while special effects don't carry a show.Oscar winning supporting cast like Christoph Waltz, the stunningly beautiful Jennifer Connolly and Ali help make the secondary characters memorable and watchable.For an action sci fi extravaganza it's okay for one watch.",positive
"Was it me or this flick but I never really got into this flick based on Anime. The story is predictable but okay and the effects are stunning but somehow it never became my thing.It's not the first time that those kind of flicks weren't made for my eyes and even as it had a good response worldwide. The directing was good, acting is okay but is it how they look that I didn't get, I don't know. Still mixed emotions even when writing this. Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5",negative
"After reading some reviews I conclude that you either love it or hate it. I guess I'm in the middle on this one. It's an entertaining movie, mostly because of the visuals, but story wise it's a bit weak. The CGI's are well done, the action scenes are better than expected, the characters could have been better. I guess there will be more movies about Alita and I will probably watch them all, but would I watch this one again? Probably not, a one time view is enough.",negative
"I believe people who will watch this movie will be either those wanting a quick CGI and action filled movie and/or those who read the manga. Both would be partially satisfied. The action sequences are spectacular, but not really good in terms of actual action. The CGI works, but doesn't bring much to the story. The actors do their job well, but in a plot that doesn't really value them. I think the hardest and most visible role was Jackie Earle Haley's Grewishka, who is at most a secondary character. Vector was diminished to the role of the basic cardboard villain, for example. All of Christoph Waltz, Jennifer Connelly, Mahershala Ali and even Jeff Fahey were completely wasted on their roles. Now, for the manga, it was clearly deeper, having more space, but it wasn't really a very complex manga to begin with. The movie, I feel, remained faithful to the story there.The biggest hope and disappointment both was the ending. The last scenes didn't make a lot of sense and the end was left open, with Alita vowing to get to Zalem to finish her job and defeat her nemesis. I hope the sequel, if any, will be better, but how often was that hope in vain with Hollywood movies. Anyway, Cameron now is focused on Avatar and the box office for the Disney/Fox leviathan was less than enticing. Here's to hope!",negative
"As a long-time IMDB reviewer, I have noticed that often films which haven't even been released have received a lot of reviews on this site. In a few cases, it's because folks saw the films at pre-screenings (such as at film festivatls), but for most it's more insidious. Some films appear to have many fake reviews--either fake positive ones (often, I assume, posted by the production companies or actors in the films) and some fake negative (such as when a fan group decides to attack a movie for some perceived slight). In the case of ""Captain Marvel"" the fake negative attacks were so many that Rotten Tomatoes decided for the first time, to not allow reviews of the film before its release. It seems a lot of fan guys objected to the perceived political correctness of the movie....and they were posting without even having seen the movie. I notice there are ALSO a lot of angry reviews here on IMDB as well...and many appear to have been posted before the film was released. Because of this, it must be very frustrating for you trying to determine whether or not it's a film worth seeing. I could say ""trust me....I am objective""....but without knowing me, I, too, could be one of these folks posting a false negative or false positive review! So, I guess you'll need to see it for yourself.For the most part, I tired of watching superhero films long ago....mostly because after a while they all seem the same. But my daughter is visiting now and she wanted to see ""Captain Marvel"" and ""Shazam!"", so I broke my resolve and went along to see these comic book-based films.I enjoyed ""Captain Marvel"" very much because it did not feel like all the other DC and Marvel films. It had a few distinctive touches which made it more exciting and worth my time. Much of it takes place in outer space and apart from bits of ""Thor"" and the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" franchises, which also take place in space, it sets the film apart. It also sets itself apart by having a female lead. And, like ""Wonder Woman"", a ton of trolls hated on the film before it was released because it had the nerve to actually have a woman in the lead! This is sad, as Brie Larson was fine in the lead and did a nice job. Ditto for the writing, as the plot had a few very nice surprises and the film kept my interest throughout. Well worth seeing and quite the adventure.",positive
"CAPTAIN MARVEL is the latest Marvel comics offering and the follow-up to AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR; inevitably it's a big step down from the success of that movie. This one goes down a much more predictable route, and it suffers hugely from having a main character who simply isn't very interesting; like Superman, her immortality and strength make her rather boring to see on screen. The film also suffers from having an unimposing villain, a crucial climactic scene openly copying RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, and generic action. On the plus side: there's a nice supporting turn from a funny and de-aged Samuel L. Jackson; the material on Earth is gently amusing, riffing on the buddy-buddy genre; there's a solid and major plot twist halfway through that really works; and Brie Larson is a decent actress. But they really need to think of something more involved next time instead of this generic amnesic hero stuff.",negative
"Vers (Brie Larson) is a powered member of the Kree Empire mentored by Commander Yon-Rogg (Jude Law). The Kree is under attack from the shapeshifting Skrulls. During a battle, Vers is captured where the Skrulls try to extract her memories. She had lost her memories six years earlier. With flashes of recovered memories, she escapes and crashes onto a Los Angeles Blockbuster. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and new agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) arrive to investigate. It's 1995 before Fury executed the Avengers Initiative. Vers searches for Dr. Wendy Lawson (Annette Bening) who is the key to her past.It's a prequel. It's an origin story. It's an exposition movie. It's a connective tissue movie. It's a female empowerment story. It's a Marvel movie. It's trying to be a lot of stuff. Despite that, it's fairly uncomplicated. It runs well without hitting any major potholes. It introduces a new hero. It gives her a very specific identity. It still has a few issues. First, Brie Larson is doing a specific character but the role is lacking in range. Essentially, she starts off with amnesia and that's not always great for character work. It's almost as bad as being brainwashed and comes off as robotic. There is one moment of great possibility when Carol is across the table with Maria for the first time in a while. That could have been a really powerful moment of female friendship. Akira Akbar is acting her butt off but Brie is restricted to her memory blanks. Her memories could have flooded back as she emotionally breaks down. They could have hugged and yes why not even shed a tear. Her character needs a different gear. The role is stuck in the robotic amnesia Jason Bourne mode. Bourne could have been a solid choice but that's not this movie either. She's wise-cracking right from the start but that's the limit of her emotional range.Second is her memory flashbacks. Instead of showing those memories early, the movie should have kept them from the audience. It becomes repetitive and we are forced to wait for Carol to catch up. The movie needs to keep the audience at the same level as Carol in her discovery. It should only reveal each memory as it comes up in the plot. Her meeting with Maria should be the point where most of her flashbacks occur like when her extended memory of the inciting incident is triggered. The movie needs to rearrange a few things.The other characters are solid. Fury is great. His humor really works. The music is mostly popular 90's female alternative voices. It's not unexpected but the climax starts with No Doubt's Just A Girl which is awkward for hitting it on its tippy tip nose. It's a weird song to fight to. It could have also added a few more male singers. It's deliberately doing something which seems unnecessary and the music taste is too similar. Why not NIN or a rapper to change the tone? I hope that Carol will be a deeper character in the future. She could face a more personal challenge with an older Monica. This film is filling out a lot of story blanks whether we like it or not, and preparing for the upcoming Avengers movie. It's fine. The Marvel universe continues.",negative
"Captain Marvel is a new 2019 film that runs for minimally over 2 hours and was written and directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck. These two have really worked together for a long time, also on some quality projects, so here they get their shot at the world's biggest superhero franchise as of course this one we got here is the most recent entry into the Marvel universe. And the title could no make it any more obvious. The lead actress is Oscar winner Brie Larsen and most of all with Oscar nominees Bening, Jackson and Law we have a fairly decent supporting cast, although Jackson is probably lead too. This film plays in the mid-1990s and takes place before Jackson summons his Avengers team. They are all not there yet, so also not a force in this movie, but Agent Coulson is and there is one scene in particular when we find out how close he and Fury are, namely when Coulson lets his buddy and the target get away and trusts him completely in making the right decision. This is the story of a female hero who knows virtually nothing about her past, but has some very impressive super powers that she fails to keep under control, however. So the entire movie is basically a journey into the woman's past, how she she finds out where she originates from and what links her with Bening's character, one that has great significance, more than you'd think compared to the limited screen time she has. Of course, Stan Lee gets also his moment here as we see him in a train when Larson's character chases a bad guy with a reference to a movie that Lee actually appeared in in the mid-1990s. And very early on, there is also another really nice tribute to Lee that I liked a lot, at the very beginning in fact. Apart from that, the comedy does not happen too rarely either here and there were more than just a few funny moments. My personal favorite was perhaps when Fury gets scanned and we hear someting like earthling, not a potential danger and finally his reaction. I must say I like Samuel L. Jackson quite a bit, so it was nice to have him featured so prominently in here. Or his character I shall say.There are some memorable moments involving his character and that refers for example to the moment he realizes that his boss there is in disguise and not who he seems he is when they enter the elevator. And apart from this reference about everybody calling him by his last name, the Havana reference is also used later on in another key scene that was actually pretty heartfelt and showed how he had a connection with the one stating said reference. You would not have expected this early on. Not at all. There is a major plot twist in this film involving Larsen's character and where she belongs. I must say I did not see it coming and it was pretty surprising, but it did feel real somehow and I always like to be surprised in movies, so I am all for it. Of course, there are also again many spectacular scenes and special effects, some of which involve Larsen's powers obviously. But there's more, like a cat (actually not a cat) with a very particular set of skills and seeing Fury interact with this cat was simply hilarious. The one thing I did not like too much were the refugee references. It's not the first time Marvel makes use of these and it did feel like a fairly clumsy attempt here too in somewhat making a connection to what is going on in the real world now treating these reptile men a bit like refugees in the sense of nomads who don't have a home. But I guess it can't be a perfect film. Apart from that, the character I liked the least was the Black best friend and her role was really not very realistic, also that she is able to be on par with these physically way superior aliens, even if she is a trained pilot. I wish she would have been out the picture. Or will be if there is a sequel.One minor thing I did not like that much was how they put together two words on several occasions turning it into one. Marvel is the best example and there were a handful others, maybe five or so and that was a bit ridiculous honestly. You will know what I mean when you hear these examples. Of course, it has nothing on the last Avengers movie, but it does not need to in order to be a success. I certainly think it is worth checking out. May also be a good idea to rewatch this one and keep an eye out for references and indicators who the good guys are and who the bad guys are. One example that comes to my mind is for example the scene I mentioned earlier with Lee when she steps into the train, the reptile man treats the old woman kindly while Larsen's character treats her pretty roughly. But there's certainly more than these and with that I do not just mean the blinking in the eye or the fact that the reptile creatures do not hurt Larsen's character one bit when capturing her. Or the young reptile playing around with her. Overall, the film and also the epilogue make me curious about the next Avengers film. I hope it wiill at least be almost as good as the previous, which would be a big achievement already. As for this one here, it is not a must-see, but still a good watch for everybody who likes superhero films like myself. I give it a thumbs-up.",positive
"Captain Marvel is another entertaining superhero adventure. Maybe the most important is not the top-notch special effects but the humor and chemistry of the cute Brie Larson and the veteran Samuel L. Jackson. The screenplay could be improved with a better development of Carol Danvers and the alien war, but anyway it is worthwhile watching. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Capitã Marvel"" (""Captain Marvel"")",positive
"I have said it before and I will say it again. The Marvel Cinematic Universe are on a higher plane compared to other superhero franchises. They can knock it out of the park, shot after shot.I went to this movie knowing almost nothing about Captain Marvel apart from there was originally another DC character with the same name who became Shazam.The film takes a little while to get going as it wants to set up the character of Vers/Carol Danvers (Brie Larson.) Vers is a warrior recruited by the Kree. They are fighting the evil Skrulls who take over planets by infiltrating them. They are shapeshifters led by Talos (Ben Mendelsohn.)After trying to get away from the Skrulls, Vers ends up in LA of 1995 where she meets a young two eyed Shield operative Nick Fury accompanied with Agent Coulson who is new to Shield.Vers though has some memories of being on earth but her memories are filled with fuzzy. Vers thinks she might had been an ace test pilot on Earth. The key is Dr Wendy Lawson (Annette Bening) who might provide more information.However it is a race against time as Skrulls are also looking for Dr Lawson and something she created.Once a de-aged Nick Fury turns up, the film hits gear. It also has a few twists in the story and the humour emerges. Marvel films always do well when they add some fun.It does stick too close to the Marvel formula, the directors Anna Boden & Ryan Fleck never put their own stamp in Captain Marvel. The hand of producer Kevin Feige is all over it.",positive
"Probably doesn't matter that I watched this film after Endgame, as I doubt knowing that Danvers is not the solution hinted at in the post-credit sequence of Infinity War. Supposedly the most powerful of the characters, and the first major solo character to be a woman, it is surprising that the film doesn't do more or take more risks. That the character continues to disappoint in Endgame is no great surprise now, given how so-so this film is. It has all the budget, stars, effects, and production standards of the wider franchise, but it somehow doesn't come together as a whole - and I'm not entirely sure why.Larson is maybe part of it, as mostly she fails to have any genuine character. The narrative structure I think made it hard for her to do it, as she is never allowed to be human apart from very brief flashbacks. Outside of this she is powerful and in-charge, which just means she is pretty dull due to lacking humour, risk, danger, or edge. Same could be said of the film as a whole, as it feels incredibly 'safe' in what it does. Jackson and a cat are the high points, otherwise it is not a particularly good standalone film, and certainly does little in the context of the series. I was sort of glad I had not seen it between Infinity War and Endgame, as the moment of those was good, and this might have taken the wind out of it a little.It is too expensive and slick to be a bad or weak film, but certainly it is not a good one. Even within the MCU it feels like a hollow affair, offering spectacle and noise, but almost nothing in the way of heart, and little in way of humour and thrills.",negative
"Alright so I'm guessing since DC brought out their movie (Shazam), many have become aware of a little fact concerning that super hero (over at the other side): Shazam once was called Captain Marvel. That was way before Marvel existed - and then Shazam (fka Captain Marvel) was not used anymore, Marvel Comics came into the mix and they just got that name for one their heroes. You can read more about this online obviously and have fun watching Shazam trying to come up with a name for ... well Shazam, in the movie DC made.All that aside, this might have felt like a full stop for some who were just waiting for Endgame. And it is understandable. Ant Man, well we knew him and so that wasn't that bad having him 6 months before Endgame came out, but Captain Marvel? Now don't get me wrong, I more than enjoyed the movie, even if certain aspects of it were clear and not that surprising (enemies of Ms. Marvel) in the twist department. But Brie Larson has so much obvious fun, it really is contagious.There was a bit of hiccup before the movie was released about some statements Brie made, but I never really got into that and whatever she said (or didn't) should not play a role in your enjoyment. I mean Samuel L. Jackson is back as the only one we know in this universe, when it comes to the MCU - and he is younger! CGI at full effect! And it really works wonders. An Origin story before the ""conclusion""? Yes (Captain) Marvel even pulled that off ...",positive
"While watching, I couldn't help thinking this film was set in the Star Trek universe. A lot of it takes place in outer space, there's mention of Imperial Cruisers, and Talos IV was a Star Trek planet. Even the Earth name of C-53 had a Trekkie feel to it. I wanted to like it but it didn't even feel like a Marvel super-hero movie. Brie Larson didn't appear to have the gravitas required of a would be champion, as the Nine Inch Nails t-shirt she wore throughout lent credence to that evaluation. Actually, it's not a bad sci-fi, fantasy flick on it's own, but if you've seen enough of them, the formula is fairly derivative. What I did like was the opening homage to Marvel comic book creator Stan Lee, and his appearance in the film as the train rider exchanging knowing glances with Carol Danvers/Vers (Larson) in true believer fashion. If you noticed, he was reading the script for ""Mallrats"".I saw this movie well after seeing ""Avengers: Endgame"", so in that film, the character of Captain Marvel was an unknown quantity for me. The origin story here is OK as far as it goes, but if you think about it, the connection of the name to the super-hero is handled once removed from that of Dr. Wendy Lawson (Annette Bening), who's Kree name was Mar-vell, and I didn't catch why one had any bearing on the other. Maybe I'm being picky, but even Larson's character didn't know who she was (see my summary line).I'm probably one of those viewers that takes issue with having an original male super-hero transitioned into a female for the sake of diversity, so if one has a problem with that, it's on me. It's just that I couldn't get too amped about this film about a character that in my estimation is a minor one in the Marvel universe. With that, I'll take my leave, and get the flerken out of here.",negative
"This was the next entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the leading hero was called upon at the end of Avengers: Infinity War, but this is a prequel to how the whole Avengers project got started, and an origins story for the female hero, the first leading female in the series, directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck (Half Nelson). Basically in 1995, on the planet of Hala, the capital of the Kree Empire, Starforce member Vers (Room's Brie Larson) is having recurring nightmares involving an older woman (Annette Bening). Her mentor and commander Yon-Rogg (Jude Law) trains her to control her abilities while the Supreme Intelligence, an artificial intelligence and the ruler of the Kree, urges her to control her emotions. The Kree are at war with the Skrulls, a race of alien shapeshifters, Vers is captured by their commander Talos (Ben Mendelsohn) during a mission to rescue an undercover operative infiltrating a Skrull group. She is taken aboard their vessel bound for the planet Earth and subjected to a memory probe. Vers escapes and crash-lands on Earth in Los Angeles in a Blockbuster store, she is found by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg). Their investigation is interrupted by a Skrull attack, following the chase, Vers recovers a crystal containing her extracted memories, while Fury kills a Skrull impersonating Coulson. Talos, disguised as S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Keller (also Mendelsohn), orders Fury to work with Vers and keep an eye on her. Fury takes Vers to a U.S. Air Force base and discovers she was a pilot presumed to have died in 1989. She was testing an experimental engine designed by Dr. Wendy Lawson, Vers recognises her as the woman from her nightmares. Talos and a S.H.I.E.L.D. tries to capture them, but they escape in a cargo jet, with Lawson's cat Goose. They fly to Louisiana to meet former pilot Maria Rambeau (Lashana Lynch), the last person to see Vers and Lawson alive. Just as Vers discovers her real name is Carol Danvers, Talos arrives at the Rambeau house, he reveals the Skrulls are refugees searching for a new home and Lawson was a renegade Kree scientist helping them. He then plays the recovered black box from Lawson's plane, prompting Danvers to remember the crash: Lawson was killed by Yon-Rogg before she could destroy the engine's energy-core, Danvers was forced to do so and absorbed the energy from the ensuing explosion, this is how she lost her memory. Danvers, Talos, Fury and Rambeau work together to locate Lawson's cloaked laboratory orbiting Earth, where Lawson hid several Skrulls including Talos' family, and the Tesseract, the source of the energy-core. Danvers is captured by Starforce and connects with the Supreme Intelligence, during their conversation she is able to access all her abilities, by removing the Kree implant that was suppressing her powers. In the subsequent battle, Fury retrieves Goose, who is revealed to be an alien with a pocket dimension inside her body and swallows the Tesseract before scratching Fury's left eye, permanently blinding it. Danvers, who earns the nickname Captain Marvel, leaves to help find a new homeworld for the Skrulls and gives Fury a modified pager to contact her in an emergency. Meanwhile, Fury drafts an initiative aimed at locating heroes like her, with abilities, he changes the name of the project after seeing a photo of Danvers in her Air Force jet, which bears the call sign ""Avenger"". In the mid-credits sequence, set in the present day, Steve Rogers aka Captain America (Chris Evans), Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Bruce Banner aka Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), and James Rhodes aka War Machine (Don Cheadle), the remaining Avengers, are monitoring the pager that Fury activated before his disintegration, Danvers appears and demands to know where Fury is. In the post-credits sequence, back in 1995, Goose jumps onto Fury's desk and regurgitates the Tesseract. Also starring Rune Temte as Bron-Char, Gemma Chan as Minn-Erva, Algenis Perez Soto as Att-Lass, Djimon Hounsou as Korath, Lee Pace as Ronan, Chuku Modu as Soh-Larr, Matthew Maher as Norex, Kenneth Mitchell as Carol's Father, Mckenna Grace as Young Carol (13 Years Old), London Fuller as Young Carol (6 Years Old), Colin Ford as Steve Danvers, Robert Kazinsky as Biker (The Don), Marilyn Brett as Older Lady on Train and Stan Lee (who sadly passed away from cancer) has a posthumous cameo as himself reading the script for his role in Mallrats, the opening Marvel Studios logo also honours his memory with clips of his cameos and on-set moment, and the words ""Thank You Stan"". Larson is well chosen as the feisty human-turned-alien heroine, Jackson is terrific and the younger future director of the Avengers, the verbal sparring between Larson and Jackson make for some highlights, and there is good support from Mendelsohn, Law and Bening. The references to the 1990s time period are clever, the special effects are amazing, especially to make Jackson twenty years younger, it does slow down at times for the necessary chat sequences, but there are enough small giggles, it packs a punch with the explosive and exciting fight and chase sequences, and it sets you up nicely for Avengers: Endgame, a fun superhero fantasy action adventure. Good!",positive
"My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. It runs right at 2 hours, there is a 30-second homage to Stan Lee at the very beginning, with the words ""Thank You Stan"", and even a 30-second scene after all the credits are finished, the orange cat in Nick Fury's office shows us what happened to the sought-after blue energy cube.Brie Larson is Carol Danvers who, in the late 1980s, becomes a jet fighter pilot. But we first see her with the Kree, they call her ""Vers"" because the only part of her dog tag that survived an incident contained the last 4 letters of her Danvers name. She is confused, she has dreams and visions but doesn't understand what they mean. When she accidentally travels back to Earth in 1995 things gradually become clear.The IMdb main page for this movie has a good synopsis in the ""Storyline"" section. What I also like about the style here is ample use of humor. They don't take themselves too seriously. It is the origin story for Captain Marvel and some drastic event is responsible for her gaining her super powers. Now she can go about helping to guard the galaxy.I am aware there are many very bad user reviews, many of them one-liners saying nothing about the movie, and often rating it ""1"" or ""2"". Those are all clearly bogus, all of us IMDb users who have written hundreds or thousands of prior reviews agree that it is a worthwhile, entertaining movie that fits well in the Marvel universe.We watched it a second time, two days later, when we had a group over for dinner. Everyone enjoyed it and I enjoyed it as much the second time.",positive
"Okay, well granted I don't have much of an active interest in superhero movies, but I still do watch them whenever I am given the chance. And recently I had the chance to sit down and watch the 2019 ""Captain Marvel"" movie. Needless to say that I had heard all the moaning and groaning online about this movie, which was the same with ""The Last Jedi"", lots of fanboys experience pains in a certain backside location.I enjoyed ""Captain Marvel"". I honestly did, and I can't find any hold in all the grief that this movie has been getting online. I guess it takes very little for a tsunami of hatred to get out of control, all thanks to elitist fanboys. Come on, this is a movie meant to entertain, it is not innovative movement within brain surgery or curing cancer. This is a movie. Plain and simple.The movie had a very simple and straight forward story, making it very easy to follow. So, as with most superhero movies, you just lean back and enjoy the action-packed ride. And yes, this is an action-packed ride.Needless to say that with this being a Marvel movie, the special effects and CGI are top notch, as it has generally been in most previous Marvel superhero movies thus far. The CGI really helps bring the movie to life on the screen with realistic-looking special effects that also look spectacular on the screen.Personally I don't get all the grief that has fallen upon Brie Larson. I enjoyed her performance in ""Captain Marvel"". Again, take into consideration that this is a superhero movie, not a heavy drama with intricate dialogue like ""Good Will Hunting"" or the like. The characters in ""Captain Marvel"" served their purpose and the dialogue was befitting of the characters and their progression throughout the course of the movie.While on the cast, then I must say that it was quite nice to see Jude Law in a movie such as this, just a shame that he wasn't given more on-screen time. And, of course, Samuel L. Jackson, well, he is Samuel L. Jackson, enough said, right? You know what you get with him in a movie. Then there was Goose, the cat. That was just a hilarious and wonderful character, and that character added a wonderful comedy element to the movie, and it fitted into the movie quite well.Personally, I must say that ""Captain Marvel"" was enjoyable to watch, and I was thoroughly entertained throughout the entire course of the movie. So, don't assume beforehand judgmental assimilations for this movie without having seen it. Who knows, you might just find it to be quite enjoyable.",positive
"After all the hype about this movie, I'll just say that me and my movie theatre-working friend really enjoyed this one! Brie Larson stars as Vers though we later find out she's had amnesia and that her real name is Carol Danvers. She also finds out about where her loyalties should be when she regains some of her memories. There's plenty of good action concerning her and some of her friends. Also, Stan Lee makes one of his last cameos having passed away several months ago. As a result, the Marvel logo at the beginning has his other cameos over the years with the greeting, ""Thank you Stan"" at the end of that. So on that note, we recommend Captain Marvel.",positive
"The story is captivating, and keeps me interested thoroughly. I didn't see the plot twists coming. There's a good mix of comedy, action and thrill. The visuals are excellent as well. The cat is really funny, and plays an integral role in the whole cinematic universe. I wouldn't have guessed it!",positive
"The 21st ""Marvel Movie"" arrives and Not Without Loudmouth Lunatics taking Sides on Social Media with Regards Concerning ""Gender Biases"" and SJW Tribalism.It will be a Blessed Day when this Type of Hand Wringing Hubris is Relegated to the Dustbin of History and Folks have Moved On and are more Enlightened about what Unites Us and what Divides Us is Not that Much in the Scheme of the Universe.The ""Marvel Universe"", Entertained the Masses for over a Decade now, and this Movie is Entertaining. It's just Not a ""Super"" Success Story wise with its Amnesia Factor Bogging Down the Exposition and seems Forced and Flat Causing more Clunk and Confusion in the Always Tricky ""Origin"" Story than Necessary.There are Highlights. A Young Nick Fury and S. H. I. E. L.

She is Intense to a Fault, but Opens Up Occasionally Coming to Life with Her ""Buddy Cop"" Scenes with Nick Fury.The Cat (obvious female symbol) ""Goose"" gets in some Diversion Screen Time. One of Her Sisterhood Friends from the Past has a Firecracker of a Daughter that Lights Up the Screen as a Side Character. The Soundtrack (more obvious female shout outs) is OK but Borders on Indulging at times.Overall, there are things to Like here but when Considering it a Part of the Marvel Team, the Plague of Pandering to Current Gender Identity Overwhelms the Better and Dampens the Proceedings a bit and keeps this from a Refreshing Ride as the Film Labors with a Confusing and Convoluted Storyline.",negative
Hmmm! This is really quite poor considering the resources thrown at it and the pretty decent cast assembled. The characters don't quite get off the comic-book page,negative
"Vers(Larson, strong, not always embracing her humanity, stirring. Just like the film itself) has only a fractured memory of her past. Over the course of this, she recalls many of the most significant parts. Originally from Earth, she was given a new life and set of abilities by the Kree, an alien race. She's now part of an elite team of theirs. Don't worry about the other members; you're not going to remember them, or need to. They're like less developed ""Warriors Three"" from Thor: though, I realise they're from the comics, if you had shaved it down to maybe just one, then that person could actually get something substantial. To do, say, be. Anyway. She has to keep a secret weapon out of the hands of the shapeshifting Skrulls. Through certain circumstances, She ends up back on this planet, and immediately attracts the attention of young desk jockey SHIELD agent Nick Fury(Jackson, less cynical than usual, which is a welcome change. Not that I didn't love him before. but it would be annoying if he was like that this whole thing. Instead we get a buddy comedy dynamic), who comes out of the de-aging looking real, and rookie Coulson(Gregg, less confident), who, in contrast, at times looks like he considers petroleum jelly a form of makeup.The action is great and plentiful, the effects are stunning, the 3D adds depth and atmosphere, the twists and mysteries keep you guessing, the villains are compelling, and the humour nearly always works. Then again, that isn't only true of this entry. So let's focus on this being the first of them that is feminist. That aspect is less focused than in Wonder Woman - the DCEU has always been taking bigger risks than the MCU, and that was one of the times where it paid off. Aquaman is the other one. Fingers crossed Shazam will be the third. It would not have been difficult to make this more about empowering women: for one thing simply make more of the characters female, even if they are men in the source material, and add more of the issues that they face. So I would say it's a case of simply being too scared to go for something unusual for them. I guess they figured they couldn't repeat the success of Black Panther, which delved incredibly deep into racial issues. Like WW, however, this will inspire young and old Members of the gender: where that motion picture was very much about feminine qualities and values solving problems that masculine ones cause, this is more about meeting the standard that men set, and surpassing it: hence, ""higher, further, faster"". While I tend to consider the former as the more progressive of the two, obviously there are a lot who want to do certain things, and are told that they can't live up to the requirements, for reasons physical, emotional, and psychological. Those saying no may even pretend that there's no sexism involved. And this will urge them to keep trying, with aforementioned three word motto serving as a rallying war cry, if you'll permit a portmanteau.There is a little strong language in this. I recommend this to everyone, XX-chromosomes in particular, not exclusively. 8/10",positive

While the screenplay by committee (6 credited scribes) occasionally goes off the rails with its mix of humor and big-scale visual effects extravaganzas (the direction by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck; ditto) the ensemble grounds it with the help of its circa 1995 setting (with a killer jukebox soundtrack laden with female empowerment tunes).",positive
"Marvel is a victim of its own success. They've been so good for so long that perfection is expected with every release. Their brand name now rivals the likes of Apple, Nike, or Coke. Slapping ""Marvel"" on a movie means $100M or more. That's not to say that they don't have to try, it's just to say that they don't have to try as hard. So, I don't say that they didn't try with Captain Marvel, I just don't think they gave their best effort.With 19 years of Marvel movies it's hard to bring along a superhero that's going to wow people. Of course there are the Marvel faithfuls that would be pleased with anything that has Marvel's name on it but for those others--what's left? After a Spider-Man, the X-Men, Hulk, Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, Blade, Ant-Man, Black Panther, Deadpool, Guardians of the Galaxy, Doctor Strange, and a host of supporting characters even a Captain Marvel seems tame. And let's be honest, how many of us saw this movie because it's attached to The Avengers: End Game?If I broke down my reasons for seeing Captain Marvel I'd say 50% because it's a Marvel movie, 40% because it's attached to The Avengers, and 10% because it's a superhero movie.At this point it's not simply about powers anymore. Sure, the superpowers are cool but they can only take a movie so far. The story needs to be good and the lead character needs to be even better. I found Brie Larson dull. Besides fitting the look needed she offered nothing. She failed to distinguish herself in a world of distinguished superheros.Marvel can easily absorb this loss and truthfully I'm probably in the minority by calling this a loss. IMO Captain Marvel didn't thrive on its own--much like Hulk didn't thrive on its own--not a problem, lets see how she does working with a team.",negative
"Greetings again from the darkness. Girl Power! Not only does this serve as an origin story for Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel, but Anna Boden becomes the first female director of a Marvel movie (she co-directed with Ryan Fleck, and they previously collaborated on IT""S KIND OF A FUNNY STORY, SUGAR, and HALF NELSON). It's Marvel's first solo female superhero movie, and even though it's actually a prequel to what we've previously seen in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), it clearly sets the table for AVENGERS: ENDGAME and the showdown with Thanos later this year.Oscar winner Brie Larson (ROOM) stars as Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel, and the film opens with her as Vers, a human-Kree hybrid and a soldier of Starforce being trained by Yon-Rogg (Jude Law) for a role in the Kree-Skrulls war. Part of the training includes regular reminders to keep her emotions under control ... see, not only is Vers a woman but she also shoots sonic blasts from her fists. The filmmakers have not presented her story in chronological order, but have instead utilized flashbacks and memories to let us (and Carol) in on how she obtained her immense powers.In Marvel tradition, the film uses much humor as it progresses. Proving that the action takes place in the 1990's, the roof literally comes down on a Blockbuster video store (foreshadowing future financial events), as Vers crashes to earth. Soon she has met young agents Fury and Coulson, played by digitally de-aged Samuel L Jackson and Clark Gregg, respectively. This is of course pre-eye patch Fury, though we do get that origin story a bit later in the film. As Vers peruses the Blockbuster shelves, we get a tip of the cap to THE RIGHT STUFF and TRUE LIES, and soon thereafter, a nod to Radio Shack, pay phones, pinball machines, pagers, and 90's era internet speed. The retro bits may be a bit overdone, but the millennial target audience will surely enjoy.The always interesting Ben Mendelsohn plays Talos, the leader of the shape-shifting Krulls - who also sport the best make-up as they transform from pointy-eared green aliens into exact replicas of humans. Lee Pace returns as Ronan the Accuser, while Djimon Hounsou is Korath and Gemma Chan is Minn-Erva, both part of Starforce. Annette Bening plays the AI Supreme Intelligence, while Mckenna Grace appears as young Carol in flashbacks.The glimpses of Carol Danvers as a US Air Force fighter pilot lead to the best dramatic scenes of the film - her reuniting with fellow pilot Maria Rambeau (Lashana Lynch) and Maria's daughter Monica (Akira Akbar). At first I was taken aback that Marvel dared cast a black actress in the role of stereotypical supportive sidekick, but then Ms. Lynch got her own impressive action chase sequence (similar to STAR WARS) and kicked some serious alien tail. Those familiar with the comics know that Maria Rambeau is the mother of Photon, a character likely to appear deeper in the universe.The co-directors also co-wrote the script with Geneva Robertson-Dworet, and Nicole Perlman and Meg LeFauve contributed to the story. The strong female presence is impressive both on camera and off, as Pinar Toprak's score complemented the heavy 1990's rock music soundtrack. Again, nostalgia seems ever-present, as does the humor (Goose the cat/flerken) and good fun that existed in THOR: RAGNAROK and ANT-MAN AND THE WASP. Carol Danvers and her backstory also seem a bit more relatable than that of WONDER WOMAN.Marvel offered up a nice tribute to the late Stan Lee by providing a new opening featuring his many cameos over the years. And yes, he was able to film his cameo for this one prior to his death in November 2018. So we have an origin story not just of Captain Marvel, but also of the Fury eye patch, the Avengers Initiative, and a prequel to all Marvel movies we've seen in the past few years. Two post-film stingers are included: one expected and necessary, while the other is good for a laugh. It's an inspiring story of a young girl who repeatedly fell down and got up and brushed herself off every time - even before her fists and eye balls could shoot energy streams. It's fitting and about time that young girls now have their own superhero to emulate.",positive
"Travelling to Birmingham to get Easter presents for friends and family,I decided that whilst in the city I would go catch a film. Visiting the oldest working cinema in the UK (The Electric) I found a flick with a run time that would give me just enough time to catch the train home,so I get set to see the new captain of the MCU.View on the film:Whilst facially de-aged with seamless CGI,Samuel (yel)L. Jackson swaggers with a coolness that has not aged one bit, with Jackson hitting Fury's comedic punch-lines with a smooth as silk ease. The first woman superhero in the Disney Marvel films to have her own solo movie, Brie Larson brings out the heroic in Marvel's passion to save the Skrulls, but fails to fly to a super height in the comedic,and establishment of her own origins,as Larson delivers punch lines with a stilted awkwardness which allows Jackson (who has worked with Larson three times) to outshine her in the jokes, and Larson also keeps a cold distance from giving Marvel the enthusiasm other superheros have when using their powers.Designed as a origin for Captain Marvel, the writers visibly show more interest in the side characters than they do in lead, with the plight of the Skrulls bringing a heart and urgency to the mission, which drifts away in the mid-section that focuses on Marvel's dry beginnings. Dipping into the Dr Strange-style fantastical with a striking sequence of Marvel fighting her inner turmoil, co-directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck are joined by cinematographer Ben Davis in largely skipping over the enticing fantastical (save for a cute cat) to deliver slick Marvel Comics action set-pieces and Star Wars-inspired space ship races, wrapped in a catchy 90's soundtrack leaving No Doubt on Captain Marvel's powers.",negative
The screenplay is convoluted and confusing. The beginning feels like you walked into a movie half way. When things start to get explained it's too late. The humor is unfunny and childish. Samuel L Jackson singing and playing with the cat. The story is so confusing and silly - bouncing around between Earth and the space ships and shifting shapes. Then the good guys are the bad guys.Miscast is the word to describe the cast. Brie and Annette are so out of place - they belong in dramas and rom coms not action movies.A black hole in the Marvel Universe.,negative
"Well, it was bound to happen sooner or later, finally a movie in the Marvel universe set of films that garnered a score less than 8 from me. Most have gotten 9's and 10's with some 8's. This one though I have to give a seven as the score, which is still a good score, nothing too bad, it just did not feel epic enough, like it was a backstory that was not important, with nothing new and no surprising moments. My least favorite up to this point was probably a tie between the third Iron Man film and the first Thor film; however, they had more going for them than this one did going for it. It just did not feel epic in the least.So, the story has a woman named Vers trying to harness her powers and having strange dreams about a past she has no memory of. She is on the planet of the Kree, which tells you right away who the villains of this one are if you have watched the other Marvel Universe films. Well, she is captured by the Skrull who probe her memory and end up near Earth as they try to find a woman from Vers past who holds the key to a light speed engine. Vers must find this woman and stop the Skrull, while agent Fury tries to get a handle on this woman who claims to be from another planet, but also seems to have ties to Earth.Captain Marvel is not really a favorite of mine. She is not really someone I dislike either. Honestly, she was not around at all when I read the comics and is pretty much a B squad hero. The first Captain Marvel was a male who was killed. I believe Carol Danvers is the second to have the moniker of Captain Marvel, but when I was reading the comics, she too had lost her life at the hands of Rogue who inadvertently killed her and took her powers of flight and super strength. So no, she was not really all that, and they totally over powered her in this film. She is not in Thor's or Hulk's class of strength, if I had to compare her to someone, it would be Iron Man. In this film, the conclusion of the film has her taking down huge space ships on her own and totally beating the bad guy's ass with ease which is just plain boring. It was also so obvious her mentor was going to end up being the bad guy, I mean the Kree had just signed a treaty in the present times, of course they were the real bad guys then!So, the film just was a bit of a bore in terms of surprises and such. The main surprise in this one is how Nick Fury loses his eye! His character adds something to the film and I thought Brie's Captain Marvel while a bit of a bore in the first part of the film becomes a bit more likable in the second half. Give her a decent opponent at the end that can put up a fight and try to come up with some good revelations and this one is better, but that is the problem setting the film in the past, too much you can mess up and there is too much we already know. The cat Goose was the best part of this one, but I still enjoyed it overall.",positive
"A lot of Marvel flicks coming out and this is another one that isn't a stand alone, better follow Agents of Shield en Avengers to understand it all. But the beauty is that when you don't follow the Marvel world you can watch this and understand almost all of it.I did like it because it has action, superb effects and overall some funny situations with the cat. Each time the cat appears I lost total control espsescially in the space ship, hilarious.Due clocking in under 2 hours, I said it before, is really okay to watch, Endgame clocked in over 3 hours, way too long. Of course it isn' all action and there's a drop just around an hour which is a bit of bla bla and that's what made me give it a 7 in stead of 8. Great to see Samuel back. I liked this one more then Endgame.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 3,5/5 Comedy 1/5",positive
"Shazam! is a frustrating film to watch. On one hand, the film tries to be more a kids' superhero movie...and excellent idea since this would help the film to stand apart from the bazillion other superhero films. But, on the other, the film has some rather adult content...making it not especially appropriate to younger viewers! So, it seems like the case of a film where the filmmakers weren't exactly sure what direction to take with the project.Billy Batson is a troubled orphan who has run away from foster home after foster home after foster home. Inexplicably, he's bestowed the superpowers that enable him to become Shazam*.....a seemingly odd choice. At first, Billy uses the power to make money and is a bit of a jerk....my favorite parts of the movie actually. Later, however, when a supervillain attacks, it's time for Billy to grow up and accept responsibility for his actions.As I mentioned above, although the film is about a kid superhero and his young companions, it also features a lot of cursing, inapproriate contenxt AND a cursing/vile Santa Claus! I honestly think the film project must have changed the focus of the film and it really seems that it's like two movies in one...and should have been one. Still, it is entertaining and, at times, quite magical...though at others it is less stellar and needed a bit of an editing.",negative
"My only previous reference to Shazam! is the 70s morning TV series that Michael Gray and Les Tremayne starred in with two different actor playing the adult Captain Marvel. It was shot on a shoestring budget with Gray and Tremayne wearing the same clothing every episode.No budgetary expense here was spared in Shazam! the movie. We get some background on the teen Billy Batson who is in a group home in Philadelphia and wants to find his parents. He's not a bad kid, but a mischievous one who is the troublemaker for the adults at the home.One fine day he's contacted from an alternate world and given the power of a superhero. Which he's fine with, but not sure how to use. Asher Angel is Billy and the adult superhero he can transform himself to is Zachary Levi. Watching Levi as the adult is like watching Adam Sandler. Maybe the producers tried for Sandler originally.Things go great until he runs into a super villain Mark Strong. It seems back in the day when Strong was a kid he entered the same realm, but was rejected. Now he's back having aligned himself with demon forces.Shazam! for all its technical wizardry is a show for kids of all ages. By the way no name for the superhero is decided so you will not hear Captain Marvel.That comes in a sequel I'm sure.",positive
"SHAZAM! is the latest superhero outing in the DC Universe franchise; this one takes a noticeably lighter, more kid-friendly tone than the previous instalments. It's generally a light and likeable affair, a superhero spin on the whole VICE VERSA body swamp storyline. The CGI effects are fairly good and more than adequate for the genre, and the storyline makes some fun nods at the 21st century obsession with social media. I wasn't too keen on the sound of the kid humour in this, but it retains the wittiness of other modern superhero outings, so it's not too bad at all. Mark Strong can be relied upon to deliver a good baddie as well.",positive
"In 1974, young Thaddeus Sivana is rejected by the wizard Shazam and indirectly causes the accident which cripples his father (John Glover). Thaddeus (Mark Strong) grows up obsessed with returning to the Rock of Eternity to confront the wizard. He's tempted by the Seven Deadly Sins and they escape. In Philadelphia, foster child Billy Batson (Asher Angel) is obsessed with finding his mother. He is taken in with other foster kids and befriended by disabled superhero-obsessed foster brother Freddy Freeman (Jack Dylan Grazer). With his last act, Shazam calls in Billy and declares him the new champion. Billy learns to be the superhero Shazam (Zachary Levi) with Freddy's help as Dr. Sivana tries to take Billy's magical powers.This has its fun. Zachary Levi delivers a performance from the little boy inside him. It has all the elements of a children's comic book superhero movie. It's good. As an adult, I have an issue with Billy Batson. He seems to be inhabiting two different characters. On one hand, he's a smirking carefree prankster. On the other hand, he's a troubled closed-off child with mommy issues. Those two personalities are sometimes on the screen one after the other and sometimes even at the same time. I do like Shazam as a scared child or as Josh in Big. I also love the surprise of the other Shazams. While Freddy does get on my nerves sometimes, I do love the eventual relationships of the foster kids. Overall, this is a fun superhero movie despite the clashing tones.",positive
"The overrated ""Shazam!"" is a disappointing adventure where the humor never works since the storyline and the screenplay are silly even for grown-up children or teenagers. Maybe the target audiences are little children that are capable to give a ten to such a turkey but for adults it is almost unbearable. The special effects are maybe the best this forgettable movie can offer. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Shazam!""",negative
"Warner Brothers decided to brighten up their DC range of superhero movies after accusations of dreariness.Shazam! who started life as Captain Marvel once upon a time tries to have some irrelevance of a Deadpool movie but remaining kid friendly although its tone is uneven.

Although it never crosses his mind that she has not been looking too hard for himA teenage Billy Batson (Asher Angel) goes through one foster home after another. He runs away from them all to search for his real mother. In his latest foster home he has joined a diverse range of foster kids including disabled foster brother Freddy Freeman (Jack Dylan Grazer) who is into Batman and Superman. Freddy gets bullied a lot and Billy helps him out. His selfless actions brings him to the attention of a wizard losing his powers.Billy gets new magical powers from the wizard but is not told the extent of his powers. Together Freddy and Billy learn what this could amount to but Billy uses Shazam to make a quick buck first until Thaddeus (Mark Strong) shows up. He is powered by the seven deadly sins and wants Shazam's magical powers.For a film released during Easter, the Christmas setting signifies some kind of last minute reshoots or re-editing. It certainly takes too long to get going and some of the Thaddeus as a kid scenes looks oddly inserted. Like many other superhero films that origins part affects the pace of the movie.The film improves when it gains momentum, that is when Shazam tries to realise the extent of his powers and confronts Thaddeus. It might have helped if the wizard told Billy what his powers were.",negative
"I'm pretty certain I'm not the only one using that summary line. And it is not because any of us are Marvel (Cinematic Universe) fanboys - well I guess it is sort of true in my case, can't talk about the others. But just to the effect that I really enjoy the movies they put out. It is not that I prefer the comics from one publisher more than others.And back to the summary line: Shazam was once called Captain Marvel! A long long time ago. He wasn't really that popular and Marvel Comics did not exist at that time. Now I won't bore you with more details (you can look them up online), I merely gave you a nudge to pursuit and look for an interesting story.Talking about interesting story: this is quite an achievement and we finally get the right amount of scary action (though one particular scene might cross the line at a meeting to the dark side) and the humor. As in trying to find a name for our super hero, but also on how he reacts to his powers and his interactions and so much more.So the right amount of everything make this a very entertaining movie - I think it didn't quite translate at the box office, but whatever the case was (I didn't check the numbers), the movie is good and the rating at least displays that at the moment (close to what I am giving it)",positive
"Finally, the DC Comics franchise managed to inject some humor into one of their super-hero projects. A lot of it works, though the story line is merely so-so, as the target audience appears to be well below the age of the average DC based film which is darker in tone. With that in mind, it probably would have been a good idea to temper some of the language to make it an all around, better family friendly picture. I didn't care much for the character of young Billy Batson (Asher Angel), his personality didn't seem right to be selected as the 'chosen one'. I actually liked his foster brother Freddy (Jack Dylan Grazer) better; he seemed to have some of the qualities, and even the looks of the young Fred Savage in ""The Wonder Years"" television program. It probably comes as no surprise that the release of this picture around the same time as ""Captain Marvel"" would confuse comic book fans who thought both Captain Marvel and Shazam were one and the same character. It even had be puzzled for a while when the titles were announced, but changing story lines, ethnicity and genders is nothing new for comic book writers looking to push the envelope on transforming existing characters. The picture is pretty well balanced between the comedic aspects of the players and the threat posed by the evil Dr. Sivana (Mark Strong) and his Seven Deadly Sin allies. The foster home setting at the center of the story was a good one to demonstrate how kids in that kind of environment can learn to overcome their circumstances and achieve personal goals and fulfillment; in that regard, teenage Mary (Grace Fulton) was a perfectly good role model. I don't know that this film would lead to an even more effective sequel, though one of the credits scenes hinted as much. I did like the final scene after all the credits rolled in which an in joke was leveled at Aquaman's expense, and the final clip in the movie proper ended things on a high note with the appearance of a faceless Superman. When the film makers follow up on this one, it would be a good idea to maintain the same sense of fun this one had.",positive
"Shazam! is one corny movie. I have no doubt that they intended it as such. While it has most of the stuff that commonly appears in superhero movies, a noticeable difference here is the positive depiction of the foster home. I figure that someone wanted this portrayal in contrast to the negative depictions of foster homes that we often see.Overall, about what you'd expect.",negative
"Teenage foster child Billy Batson (Asher Angel) dreams of being reunited with his mother; being a superhero couldn't be further from his mind. But that's what he becomes when an ancient wizard (Djimon Hounsou) chooses him to be his successor, endowing him with super strength, lightning fingers, invulnerability, and the power of flight. Unfortunately, Billy's new ability to turn into a muscle-bound hero (played by Zachary Levi) whenever he says 'Shazam!' coincides with the appearance of a supervillain, Dr. Sivana (Mark Strong), who was rejected by the wizard as a child, and who has spent the rest of his life looking for a way to seize the powers he was deemed unworthy of.Shazam! is DC's attempt at a lighter, more humorous approach to the whole superhero schtick, something I wholeheartedly approve of, not being a big fan of the grim and gritty Batman/Superman films of recent years - but it isn't wholly successful. Billy discovering precisely what he is capable of in his hero state is reasonably fun, his amazing antics documented by his disabled foster brother Freddy (Jack Dylan Grazer), but when Dr. Sivana enters the picture, the film becomes little more than a mundane superhero flick, full of CGI-driven smackdowns, but little in the way of originality. At well over two hours long, it soon starts to feel more like a chore than a pleasure, especially with much of the intended comedy falling very flat.As with the majority of superhero films, Shazam! is cleaning up at the box office despite its faults; I just hope they try a little harder with the script and the action for the inevitable sequel (which looks set to feature a talking caterpillar called Mega Mind).5.5/10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb.",negative
"My wife and I watched this movie on BluRay from our public library, I have seen a movie in a theater only twice since 1999.We became fans of actor Zachary Levi back in 2007 when he starred in the TV series ""Chuck."" We haven't seen him in much since that series went away but here he has the starring role, as the guy with super powers when he says "" Shazam"" after a mysterious encounter with a purveyor of black magic. He really is teenager Billy Batson but he converts into the costumed super hero after uttering the words.We were entertained but I came away a bit disappointed. Instead of approaching his transformation somewhat seriously, with some humor thrown in, as was done in ""Spiderman"" for example, the whole story is presented more as funny fluff. Some of it is interesting, like when he and his friend explore to determine what all his powers are, but the overall feeling was much less serious.Both my wife and I commented that it reminded us of Tom Hanks in ""Big"" where he looked like an adult but had a childlike approach to everything. So yeah, a fun movie but just a popcorn movie with a few serious themes thrown in.",positive
"Granted, I can't claim to hold much of any particular interest in the superhero genre, yet I have seen almost every single one put out there so far. Why? Well, because I enjoy watching movies and given the chance, then I will definitely watch a movie or at least give it a chance.Turns out that ""Shazam!"" was actually entertaining, well at least for what it turned out to be. It wasn't a superhero movie that took itself all that seriously. But then again, I am not familiar with ""Shazam!"" or the tone used in the comic books. But for me, as being unfamiliar with it, then it was adequate entertainment to watch a boy turn into a grown up and gain super powers at the blink of an eye.It was nice to see a superhero movie that didn't turn dark and brooding, like the Marvel movies have a tendency of doing. ""Shazam!"" was what it was, a superhero movie mixed with some comedy.The acting in the movie was good, and I think that Zachary Levi, playing Shazam, actually carried the movie well with his charming appearance and his demeanor. He definitely made the movie more enjoyable for me. I've always thought that Mark Strong was a good actor, and he was quite nicely cast for the villainous role in the movie.As for the special effects, yeah, it is a superhero movie after all, so of course it is going to need special effects. And yes, the CGI and special effects people definitely delivered something that was quite pleasing for the eyes. I liked what I saw here.The combination of comedy and action superhero genre was actually working well in favor for ""Shazam!"" and if most definitely made it more bearable and enjoyable for me to sit through a superhero movie.So after the movie ended, is ""Shazam"" a superhero that I want to watch in more movies? Well, not particularly no. He was fun for what it was, and that was about it. But I can't really imagine a whole series of movies with this character.Definitely a watchable superhero movie, but not a particularly outstanding one.",positive
"The poster of the film looks rather frivolous to me, so I do was Connelly blown away by how good the film is.

"Foster kid Billy Batson (Asher Angel) is given super powers by an ancient wizard. When he says :""Shazam"" he transforms from a 15 year old kid to a 30 something muscular super hero (Zachary Levi). However he's still a kid emotionally. Then he has to battle the evil Dr. Sivana (Mark Strong)...but he's still a kid inside.I wanted to like this movie more than I did. It has great special effects, the acting is good (even though Levi overacts more than once) and the story is OK. However it moves VERY slowly (Shazam doesn't even show up until almost an hour in), its morals are questionable (we're supposed to find it cute that Shazam is drinking beer and stealing from an ATM machine) and the final battle goes on forever with too many superheroes and villains. Also the bullying some kids go through in this is way too brutal. One crippled kid is knocked to the ground and kicked around! So I honestly did not like it too much. It's just too long.",negative
"It depends on what you want from the film as to whether or not you will enjoy this. I knew nothing at all about the Shazam character, I just wanted a couple of hours of distraction at the cinema on a wet Tuesday night. I got it! It is a well put together, light-hearted superhero film. It doesn't purport to be anything more sophisticated and that's just as well. It has no depth to it at all, but Zachary Levi delivers in an enjoyable, slightly comedic, throw-away little movie and Mark Strong is just about evil enough as the baddie. Sometimes simplicity is all that is required.",positive
"The road that most comic book superheroes take to reach the silver screen is usually straightforward. The latest character to enter the ranks of the DC Extended Universe, ""Shazam!,"" emerges as a major exception to the rule. Indeed, the Shazam character began life as none other than Captain Marvel! Now, this revelation may surprise everybody who loves superhero movies. After all, didn't ""Captain Marvel"" appear recently as the newest addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe? Sure, she did, but the history of the character goes back further than you might imagine. Initially, the original Captain Marvel had nothing to do with either Marvel or DC Comics. Instead, Fawcett Comics created this character and ushered it into print in February 1940. Captain Marvel's popularity proved so prodigious that before long Fawcett's superhero surpassed the sales of the then invincible champion of costume-clad crimefighters: DC Comics' Superman. Not long afterward, however, DC sued Fawcett for copyright infringement, and Fawcett had to cease publishing ""Captain Marvel.""What a complicated trajectory for a superhero's reawakening! In the late 1970s, Marvel Comics acquired its own Captain Marvel, but he shared little in common with the original Captain Marvel. Actually, Marvel's first Captain Marvel was a man, before he became a woman. Meanwhile, DC Comics appropriated the old Captain Marvel from Fawcett. To avoid the prospect of yet another breach of copyright, DC changed Captain Marvel's name, opting for the magic word ""Shazam!"" that fourteen-year old foster child Billy Batson--uttered before he could transform himself into this formidable adult superhero. For the record, DC Comics bought the character from Fawcett in 1972 and then rebooted him in a 2011 graphic novel. Moreover, DC Comics kept Captain Marvel's pristine scarlet red outfit with a jagged lightning bolt across his chest. Interestingly, the first theatrical superhero chapter serial was Captain Marvel! Indeed, ""The Adventures of Captain Marvel"" (1941) beat both ""Batman"" (1943) and ""Superman"" (1948) to the silver screen.As an origin epic, ""Shazam!"" charts a new direction for DC superheroes. Just as ""Deadpool"" stood the Marvel Cinematic Universe on its head, ""Shazam"" has done something similar for the DC Universe. The extraordinary thing about this new entry is that he literally qualifies as a superhero without a clue. Runaway juvenile Billy Batson (newcomer Asher Angel) ends up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with a new foster family, but this doesn't dissuade him from pursuing his dream. He wants desperately to find his long, lost mother (newcomer Caroline Palmer), and he does. Alas, she wants absolutely nothing to do with him! Whereas Superman and Batman lost their parents respectively to a doomed planet and a homicidal maniac, Billy loses his mom because she no longer wants the responsibility of raising him. Of course, it is traumatic to see your folks shot dead in front of you or learn afterward that your folks perished when your home planet blew up. Imagine how devastating it must be to have your own mom disown you! Billy turns out to be an ideal candidate to replace an ailing, ancient-looking Wizard (Djimon Hounsou of ""Amistad"") who stipulates that his successor must be someone pure of heart. No sooner has Billy uttered the magic word ""Shazam"" than he finds himself empowered beyond belief. By the way, Shazam is an acronym for the six immortal elders: Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles, and Mercury. After he winds up in his new foster home, Billy hangs out with an obnoxious, crippled, foster kid, Freddy Freeman (Jack Dylan Grazer of ""It""), whose vast knowledge of superheroes enables Shazam to catalog his powers.""Lights Out"" director David F. Sandberg and ""Earth to Echo"" scenarist Henry Gayden take an exhilarating, tongue-in-cheek approach to the material. Shazam (Zachary Levi of ""Thor: Ragnarok"") and Freddie are in a convenience store when two hooligans hold the cashier at gunpoint. Freddy dares them to shoot the shenanigans out of Shazam with their firearms. Struggling to appear casual, Shazam accommodates this suicidal challenge. Happily, the bullets all bounce harmlessly off his spandex costume. Afterward, Freddie urges them to blast away at Shazam's face. Similarly, the slugs rebound off his mug! Ultimately, the short-sighted Shazam doesn't exploit his vast potential to serve the best interests of society until the super-villainous Dr. Thaddeus Sivana (Mark Strong of ""Green Lantern""), arrives to confront him. Silvana covets Shazam's powers, and he is prepared to do whatever is necessary to wrest those powers from him. Shazam doesn't know how to defend himself against somebody so consummately evil because at heart he is just a teenager! Sivana quickly opens our hero's naïve eyes. As an adversary without scruples, Dr. Sivana is the epitome of wickedness, and Mark Strong delivers a bravura performance bristling with menace. Earlier, Sivana had a crack at those same super powers when he himself was a juvenile. Unfortunately for him, the Wizard found Sivana lacking any semblance of innocence. Nevertheless, Sivana embarks on several examples of supreme savagery before he suffers his comeuppance.Predictably, our immature hero comes to grips with his qualms and demolishes his antagonist when Sivana threatens the demographically diverse members of his foster family. ""Shazam,"" however, qualifies as more than just another standard superhero saga. Zachary Levi's sidesplitting performance as Billy Batson's alter-ego Shazam works splendidly because Levi doesn't try to be funny. Shazam behaves like a deer paralyzed by car headlights. At first, he fears Sivana and flees in fright. Eventually, Shazam realizes he cannot tolerate Sivana's anarchy. Ultimately, Billy--who had sworn the other kids in his foster home to secrecy about his identity--shares his power with them. These suddenly mature kids with costumes and super powers not only thwart Sivana's evil aims, but they also chastise two insufferable bullies at school. More than anything else, ""Shazam!"" succeeds chiefly because of Levi's endearing portrayal of a charming but clueless superhero. Sandberg and Gayden duplicate all the traditional superhero tropes, but they provide such spontaneity that what might have seemed stale is now fresh and funny.",positive
"Billy Batson(Angel, charming, snarky, ultimately sweet) has gone from one foster home to another. Now he's put in a group home. And if the characters and pathos therein don't stir up any emotions in you, you are made of stone. At first he resists becoming part of their family. In his mind only blood relatives count. And his mother is still out there. And when he finds her everything will be perfect again. Over the course of this he grows to be more responsible, more caring, and opens up. A wizard(Hounsou, determined if aging) finds him pure of heart, even though he disagrees with that assessment. As such he is made the champion. Given the abilities of ancient gods. Put in the body of a grown man. Faced with this fantastical set of circumstances, he does want any of us would do. Any that are teens or in contact with the inner child, that is. He shows off, charges people for selfies, and buys beer and does other things only adults are allowed to. Meanwhile, Dr Thaddeus Sivana(Strong, sinister) has spent almost half a century trying to find the man who deemed him unworthy. Something his brother and father were already calling him regularly. When he does, he unleashes the Seven Deadly Sins, creatures made up of nothing but evil and mostly convincing CGI. Honestly it's only really when they are touching a live action element that it looks dodgy. These two superpowered people are the only ones who can injure each other. Who will win?Given the tone I would only show this to someone 13 or older. It simply gets too graphic, scary, intense and disturbing at times. Also, there are jokes that push it to that level, though none going as far as those of Deadpool. They have slightly different audiences, intentionally so. This does subvert expectations and have a lot of fun with its concept. Hilarious from start to finish. It is also an incredibly big-hearted film. Among its beautiful messages are ""while nobody's perfect, if you find someone who loves you, you should give them a chance"". Good and Evil is not a matter of what you can do, rather, it's about what you choose to do with what you have. The climax is grander and more effects-driven than what came before. I completely disagree with those that say that it then becomes exactly like lesser movies like it. It went in a direction I didn't see coming, and I felt was hugely satisfying, building on elements that had been given a lot of attention.I recommend this to anyone that finds the core idea even remotely appealing. 8/10",positive

Director David F. Sandberg lays on the visual effects with aplomb making for exciting and crowd-pleasing set pieces helped along by its committed by design screenplay by Henry Gayden and Darren Lemke's adaptation of the Bill Parker/CC Beck DC comic book.

"I watched this movie on a flight from Phoenix to Chicago, and enjoyed it. Would I have liked it as much sitting in the comfort of my own home with a larger array of other options to choose from? Not sure. But as it is, it's a light-hearted change of pace from the usual bloated superhero movie, and it did make me chuckle quite a few times. I'm not sure if Zachary Levi has what it takes to be a major movie star, but he's winning enough in this movie. It's not like all that much was required of him.Grade: B+",positive
"With my first IMAX at the Manchester Printworks (second biggest screen in Europe) viewing having been the pretty poor Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald (2018-also reviewed),I kept an eye on what was coming out,in the hope it would be a big improvement. Getting set to go Manchester again to get Easter presents, the comedic ads caught my eye,and led to my second IMAX viewing being a call of Shazam!View on the film:Following James Wan in going from the world of The Conjuring to the world of the DCEU, director David F. Sandberg's horror sensibility shines through,from Sandberg and Alexandre Aja's regular cinematographer Maxime Alexandre giving the opening a dark and stormy night appearance, snarling, demonic gargoyles and baddie Sivana dressed in black with an eye on unleashing Seven Deadly Sins. Conjuring the villains from Horror, Sandberg wonderfully contrasts the look of the baddies with the bright, animated sparks of Shazam igniting a bubbly mood.Whilst blue bolts and floating things do appear, Sandberg zaps them aside by giving the slick action scenes off-beating settings, such as the thunderous final battle in a Christmas market. The first Shazam flick since 1941, the screenplay by Henry Gayden & Darren Lemke flies over the DCEU mythology and lands on zig-zag gags snapping pics at the fun of having superpowers. Matching the more serious Horror edge from Sandberg, the writers make the gags land by smartly making Shazam's search to be part of a family be the sincere spine of the tale. Backed by deadly sins, Mark Strong gives a delicious turn as Sivana,with Strong cutting thick slices of ham as Sivana pounds Shazam into the ground. Two sides of the same hero, Asher Angel brings a warmth to Batson being a loner, whilst Zachary Levi captures the excitement that grips Batson when he says Shazam.",positive
"Billy Batson is a foster child who is proving a nuisance to Child Services with his search for his mother.In his latest foster home, Billy makes friends with Freddy, and finds himself selected by a Wizard to be his new protege.Now with the ability to instantly become a superhero by saying the films title, Billy begins to explore his new powers with Freddy.But Billy soon learns that he has an equal enemy, Dr. Thaddeus Sivana, who has accepted the power of the Seven Deadly Sins instead.Now pursued by Sivana for his own power as well, Billy must face up to the responsibilities, and realising that family can be important....Going by the trailer, you'd be forgiven for thinking that Shazam! would be a homage of Big and the current slew of comic book movies we have has since Stark first graced our screen.DC more or less promised that this was the brighter side of their Universe, and the trailers promised that also, but my goodness, this has some very dark scenes, and connotations to the nuclear family that give the film a dark tone throughout.The first 50 minutes of the film is way too long, and could have done with trimming at least the opening Gambit of Sivana as a child. This set the mood for the entire film, and stayed with you until the end. Potentially, it does make Strong appear as a more formidable foe, but a little flashback would have sufficed, so we could have spent more time on the 'fun' stuff.And when we do get to Levi, the film does go up a gear, but again, it spends too long with the Queen song and the bumbling around with the super powers, which made it feel like a more comic 'Chronicle'.Strong is good in his role, but as I've said before, some scenes with him in are very disturbing, and feel out of place for a film that should have a much more lighter tone.For a universe that is universally panned because it's not Marvel, DC have taken a massive gamble with Shazam, and it sort of pays off, with some fun references to other films from the DCEU, and it does pick up after an hour, but that opening sequence is really too dark for this film.Good, but it takes far too long to get to the meat of the story.",positive
A nice difference from the usual this fun and involving action comedy involves kids becoming superheroes. The grown ups are actors we like. The kids are cute and not annoying.Well done.,positive
"It is always cool when a super hero you like finally gets their own movie and I was excited when I first started to see the trailers to this one. I was also excited to see that Dwayne Johnson was going to be Black Atom. Well, I got saddened to learn that he would not be in this film and even more depressed when I learned that they were going to recast Henry Cavill as Superman as this just highlights the problems DC has had trying to bring a shared universe to the big screen. They recast, they plan to make a new Batman series not in the shared universe and a Joker movie and they have so many television shows of their characters. They are watering down their own universe and this is why Marvel will continue to chug along while DC will crash when they flip in new cast among Gal Gadot and Jason Momoa confusing viewers as to whether it is a continuation or something new. This film, thankfully, stands on its own quite well. Sure it exists within the DC universe, but you needn't see any of the other films to enjoy this one.The story has a young Billy Batson having trouble fitting into foster homes as he desperately tries to find his mother. Well, after he takes up for one of the kids at his new home he is brought into the realm of the wizard Shazam whom grants Billy his powers as a last ditch effort because the seven deadly sins have entered a man obsessed with finding the wizard after he was deemed unworthy of being the keeper of Shazam's powers as a child. Billy uses the powers a bit for his own gain, unsure how to control them, but is forced into action when Dr. Sivana and the deadly sins inside him wish to eliminate Shazam so that none can stand before him!The casting is rather good, I found it a bit strange that they got Mark Strong to play the villain in this one as he also played Sinestro in the Green Lantern film where he never got to be the main villain in the non existent sequel to that film. Zachary Levi plays Shazam here and he does a pretty good job, although it is obvious that the costume is the reason he has the muscles in this one. the child actors all do a good job in this one as well.So, it was a good film, would have enjoyed it more had they included the Rock as Black Atom in this one. They introduced another Shazam enemy though that is a bit more obscure so I am guessing he may be in the sequel making me wonder if Black Atom is going to be in any Shazam movie, which considering DC's track record I can see them totally screwing up and not adding him. These Shazam movies are going to have a short shelf life though as the kids are going to get older, so it may be a one and done due to DC's like of vision. Which is a shame as it looked like they were beginning to get on a role with Aquaman before they started the lets recast Superman stuff.",positive
"The inevitable third chapter of the JOHN WICK franchise continues on a high with the same quality as the last. In fact, this may just pip that one to the post to be the best JOHN WICK yet. The pacing is spot on and the plotting is measured by a huge amount of action sequences, all of which fizz and crackle with skill and energy. The movie hits the ground running as Keanu faces off with a hulking character in a library and then Triads in a weapon shop, but what really amazes here is the sheer inventiveness of the non-repetitive action. There are horse and motorbike chases, a Moroccan brawl with fighting dogs, alongside the massive action of the climax. There also seems to be a greater emphasis on hand-to-hand combat, featuring the likes of RAID actors and old-timer Mark Dacascos, which is a real pleasure as the choreography is top-notch. In terms of sheer enjoyment, this is a film hard to beat, and to criticise it at all is unnecessary. Bring on the fourth!",positive
"John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is excommunicated by the High Table and a $14 million bounty is placed on his head. This reminds me of The Warriors. It has a lot of gun fu action as John Wick go on a difficult journey against various criminal gangs. It has loads of fun action. The plot is simple although it would be better to have Wick map out his quest. There are good fun to be had except for Halle Berry. She seems to be trying earn an Oscar for some reason. This is action fun. It's not Monster's Ball. This is all about the fights, the knives, the close gun shots, and the cool cool fights. It's about fun.",positive
"The overrated ""John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum"" is an action film that gives the sensation of watching a boring videogame. The plot is only John Wick running and killing the assassins that want the 14 million dollar award for his head. After the initial original deaths, the film becomes tiresome, boring and repetitive. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""John Wick 3: Parabellum"" (""John Wick 3: Parabellum"")",negative
"After Speed came out in 1994, I did not expect Keanu Reeves to still produce the goods in action movies 25 years later.John Wick 3 owes more than a passing nod to The Raid films. In fact two stars from that franchise appear in this movie.In the previous film, John Wick broke the rules and did an unsanctioned kill inside the Continental Hotel. Now John Wick is excommunicado and a $14 million bounty is placed on him. Every assassin is after him.The manager of the Continental, Winston (Ian McShane) has his own problems to deal with the Adjudicator sent by the High Table for helping Wick by giving him a one hour head start. Wick meanwhile needs to find a way to Morocco to find the Elder and make peace with him. Everywhere John Wick goes someone is trying to kill him.A little too long, but as brainless action films go, this was enjoyable. I particularly liked Halle Berry fighting with her two dogs. John Wick fights with knives, swords, horses, books and all kinds of guns.With two Oscar winners in the cast, director Chad Stahelski adds a bit of opulent style to the brutal action such as Russian Ballerinas trained by Anjelica Huston while protected by Belarusian heavies.",positive
"It is 5 years since the first John Wick film - one that took me by surprise by how silly it was as a narrative, but yet how well it delivered action sequences. The second film was only 2 years ago, and it raised the stakes and went from a man seeking revenge on another group of people, into one where the world was filled with assassins, popping up from everywhere all the time. I remember ending that film feeling like it had gone too far but that the third would probably do more of that. True enough, Parabellum (""prepare for war"") sees the whole world filled with assassins, and a huge administrative system around them - but yet the whole lot of them can't seem to cause John Wick too much trouble. As with the first film, this expands the world more than it can bear, and although it looks cool at times, the world makes no sense whatsoever and it hurts the film the more it relies on it (which it does as it expands it).The simplicity of the first film is therefore gone, and the slick fun is hurt because it feels bloated in scale, and has to work to sell this unsellable world to the viewer. At its best though, the film doesn't concern itself with this and instead has nicely flowing sequences of well-choreographed violence that is well directed and performed. It is brutally violent but it is almost like a ballet to watch it. Having two cast members from The Raid films had the positive impact of having them, but there was a negative too because those films manage to deliver stakes and tension in the violence - something John Wick just doesn't manage to ever do. I enjoyed the flow and pace, but never got caught up in a fight in a way where it had me on the edge of the seat; contrast the fight with Yayan Ruhian and Cecep Arif Rahman, and the fights that the two are involved with in The Raid 1 and 2 respectively - their John Wick fight is enjoyable but their fights in The Raid movies had weight, danger, and risk.The endless lack of consequence does make it hard to stay engaged with, and it needs it to be cool and slick so that we never connect it to the real world - but seeing people stabbed in a busy train station with people just walking by without reaction does make that hard, for example. It is still slick, quite enjoyable tosh, and very well put together in terms of fight sequences, but it does feel bloated and overlong, and could have done with a tighter world - although I guess they cannot put that back in the box after the second movie took it out. Enjoyable for what it is, but it has a lot of weaknesses that detract while watching.",positive
"Where could John Wick go? And yes pun intended or rather multiple meanings implied. As you can tell by a third installment, he still had places to go, things to do and people to kill. Though his motivations are different now. While it is not necessary to have seen the other Wick movies, it does make sense. They are also quite good, if you like action flicks.So John is a persona non grata ... he is the target for other killers and who doesn't like a bounty/money? Well some may have been better off if they just passed on this ""opportunity"", but that wouldn't have made for a good movie now, would it? We also get a couple of new characters, portrayed by Halle Berry and Marc Dacascos. The latter may be the main antagonist, but he is very likely to become a favorite for a lot of audience members. Amongst all the action and mayhem (not for kids then), there is quite some wicked humor. It is necessary to lighten up the whole thing, not because of any need to cover for bad stunts - quite the opposite is the case. The choreography is top notch once again and there is no fatigue breaking in ... well bring on Part 4 then",positive
"Picking up right where Chapter Two left off, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) finds himself on the run from an open contract hit registered by his friends at the High Table. I kind of like the whole idea of an elite organization keeping it's members in line with the threat of 'excommunicado', but there were many examples of the hierarchy reversing course and failing to follow through. Like the Adjudicator (Asia Kate Dillon) giving Winston (Ian McShane) and the Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne) seven days to vacate their base of operations. And how about The Elder (Saïd Taghmaoui) offering Wick a position back under the High table if he fulfilled a hit on Winston. The premise of maintaining a very strict standard of conduct for the elite assassin's guild was repeatedly undermined in the story line, and created a departure from Chapter Two.As for the action, while at the same time I love it, have to admit that it gets so over the top that at times it becomes comical. Like the stable horses taking out Wick's assassins - priceless!! When Wick goes to Casablanca, it's the same old, same old after teaming with Halle Berry's character Sofia. With perfunctory breaks in the gun play to reload, the bullets keep flying and through it all, Wick and Sofia are practically invulnerable from the barrage of bullets flying their way, while the opposing body count mounts to triple digit proportions. It's so unrealistic that, as I say, you have to laugh after a while. Not to be outdone by Wick's fall from a high rise near the end of the story, smacking into fire escapes and plummeting to the pavement in as sure a way to die as any movie maker could come up with. And yet he survives! to set up the sequel that will be 'John Wick Four'.Look, there's no way you can take any of this seriously, and I think this 'Parabellum' excursion really took the story line into fantasy land. But if you like this stuff, and I do, it can be an entertaining two hour diversion to vicariously live the assassin's life and come out unscathed. Physically that is, mentally I'm not so sure.",positive
"The first film was a surprise box office hit, and naturally a sequel followed, which ended on a cliffhanger, I saw them both on DVD or online, this was going to be the first of the films I would see in the cinema, and I looked forward to it. Basically set an hour after the conclusion of the previous film, former hitman John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is now a marked man on the run in New York, he has been given one hour ""grace period"". After killing a crime lord of the High Table Santino D'Antonio, doing so unsanctioned in the New York City Continental, John has been declared ""excommunicado"", the bounty on his head stands at $14 million. Following the activation of the bounty, John reaches the New York Public Library and recovers a crucifix necklace and a ""marker"" medallion from cache hidden in a book. He fights his way through various assassins populating the city, until he reaches the Director (Anjelica Huston), a woman from his past, who accepts the crucifix as a ""ticket"" for safe passage to Casablanca, Morocco. The Director also brands Wick to signify that he has used up all his favours with her. Meanwhile, the Adjudicator (Asia Kate Dillon) meets with Winston (Ian McShane), the manager of the New York City Continental, and the Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne), the leader of a network of assassins. The adjudicator admonishes both for helping John Wick kill Santino D'Antonio, they are both are given seven days to give up their offices or face serious consequences. In Casablanca, John meets Sofia (Halle Berry), a former friend and the manager of the Casablanca Continental. He presents his marker and asks Sofia to honour it by helping him get to The Elder (Saïd Taghmaoui), a high-ranking member of the High Table, so that he can get the bounty relinquished. Sofia takes him to assassin Berrada (Jerome Flynn), who tells John that he will find the Elder by wandering through the desert until he cannot walk any longer. Berrada asks for one of Sofia's dogs in exchange for this information, she refuses, he shoots the dog (it survives with a bullet proof jacket). In rage, Sofia shoots Berrada, she and John fight their way through the various henchmen, until they escape the casbah and flee into the desert. Having fulfilled her marker, Sofia leaves John in the desert, he roams until he collapses from exhaustion. He is found by The Elder's men, and meeting the man himself, John explains his actions, saying he is desperate to live and ""earn"" the memory of the love he had with his wife. The Elder agrees to forgive John, only if he assassinates Winston and works for the High Table until his death. To show his commitment, John severs his ring finger and gives his wedding ring to The Elder. Meanwhile, the adjudicator has recruited the assassin Zero (Mark Dacascos) and his ""students"" to find and kill John. With Zero's help, the Director and the Bowery King are accosted for their actions, both are maimed as penance, the Bowery King almost fatally. John arrives back in New York City and is pursued by Zero's men but reaches the Continental and takes sanctuary. Winston encourages John not to die as a killer but as a man who loved and was loved by his wife. The adjudicator arrives, but Winston refuses to give up his office, and John refuses to kill Winston. Consequently, the adjudicator ""deconsecrates"" the Continental, allowing killing in the building. Zero and his men are notified by the adjudicator, two busloads of body-armoured High Table enforcers arrive. With the help of the hotel's concierge, Charon (Lance Reddick), John defends the Continental from the enforcers, killing them with armour-piercing shotgun shells. John is then ambushed by Zero and his ""students"", he defeats and kills all but two of the ""students"", then kills Zero. The adjudicator negotiates in a discussion with Winston, he offers penance to the High Table. John arrives, the adjudicator identifies him as a threat to the negotiation, so Winston shoots John repeatedly, causing John to fall from the Continental's roof. The Continental returns to operation, but the adjudicator informs Winston that John's body has disappeared and that he remains a threat to them. A wounded John Wick is taken to the heavily scarred Bowery King, who is angry with the High Table and will be fighting against them, John agrees to join him. Also starring Jason Mantzoukas as Tick Tock Man, Randall Duk Kim as Doctor and Gotham's Robin Lord Taylor as Administrator. Reeves remains cool and focused as the former assassin that will not be messed with, the revenge element has disappeared, the antihero is simply fighting for survival, it does not feel quite as fresh as before, the fights are well choreographed, but a little repetitive, but the escalating body count, over-the-top deaths and violence still just about work, it is still a worthwhile action thriller sequel.

"After the events in the previous film protagonist John Wick has been declared excommunicado for killing a member of the 'High Table'. This means all other members of the organisation are forbidden from aiding him and there is a price on his head... $14,000,000! Luckily he has a couple of debts to call in so manages to get out of New York and into Casablanca. Here he sets about finding The Elder, the leader of the organisation to plea to be allowed to live. When he finds him he is told the price of his life will be high. Meanwhile an 'adjudicator' turns up in New York to punish Winston, the manager of the New York Continental, and the 'Bowery King' for helping John.If you are a fan of full on action with only a relatively simple plot then the 'John Wick' films are just the thing. No time is wasted telling the viewer what happened before this film starts so I'd definitely recommend watching the previous two films first. If you do go into this without seeing the previous instalments you'll soon figure out that it is basically John Wick and a handful of friends versus everybody else. The action starts quickly and apart from a couple of pauses to advance the plot continues till the credits roll. The action is nicely varied with shooting, knife-fighting, sword-fighting and hand to hand combat... not to mention two attack dogs with a propensity for biting their owner's enemies in the groin! Keanu Reeves really impresses as our eponymous anti-hero and the rest of the cast is solid too. Special mention must be given to all the stuntmen; their characters may be nameless goons only in the film for a few seconds before getting dispatched but they make the viewer believe the over-the-top action. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of action films; do be warned though if you are offended by on-screen violence you certainly won't like this. I can't wait for Chapter Four.",positive
"Assassin John Wick is referred to as Baba Yaga in this third chapter, suggesting that he is, in fact, a supernatural being; his ability to evade death, appear and disappear like a ninja from a Godfrey Ho film, and move with lightning fast reflexes despite being in his mid-fifties confirms this fact, in my opinion. Unfortunately, Wick's invincibility means that the many action scenes in Parabellum are largely devoid of excitement, the only outcome being that Wick is still alive and all of his enemies are dead.Chapter 2 set things up for a potentially entertaining part three, ending with John Wick (Keanu Reeves) on the run, hunted by the world's top assassins, all keen to collect the bounty on his head. This film should have been a whole lot of outrageously OTT comic-book fun, with an array of bizarre and unique killers, each with their own distinctive look and style; it certainly starts off on the right foot with a few of fun fight scenes (one against a tall guy in a library, another in a shop full of knives, and one in a stable that makes good use of the horses), but it all goes downhill rapidly after that.A pack of trained dogs easily outshine their human co-stars in one skirmish, a fight involving samurai swords and motorbikes blatantly borrows from The Villainess (2017), and a battle between Wick and Mark Dacascos in a glass room is frustratingly tedious (despite Dacascos's impressive martial arts skills). I blame director Chad Stahelski, who hasn't progressed as a film-maker since part one, content to simply give fans more of the same. The preposterous ending is the icing on the cake, John Wick surviving falling several stories from the roof of a building. Enough already!5/10, minus one point for the retro-technology used by the tattooed administrators working for the 'high table': Commodore 64 keyboards, green CRT monitors, rubber stamps, rotary dial phones. Seriously, what is the point?",negative
"The previous two ""John Wick"" movies were quite good, filled with action and had adequate storylines. And the ""John Wick"" movies definitely is what brought Keanu Reeves back on the map for me. So of course I had to watch ""John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum"" as well.Wow. Just wow! That is essentially all that needs to be said to summarize this third installment in the series. John Wick (played by Keanu Reeves) is back and better than ever.This third movie continues on from the previous two movies, but it kicks up the action and adrenaline a notch. Quite a notch actually. This was an action-fest in every sense of that term. From the very beginning to the very end, there wasn't a single dull moment to be had. And director Chad Stahelski really brought the audience along on an action thrill ride like none other.Not only is this third installment in the series more action packed, but it also hosts multiple great acting performances by some rather interesting casted talents. I must admit that I had my doubts about Halle Berry, but she really surprised me here with her performance as Sofia and proved that she really can hold her own in an action movie such as ""John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum"". And of course Keanu Reeves needs little praise here, because he is back in top form and I dare even say that the ""John Wick"" movies are his best movies in his entire career thus far. Now, Ian McShane is always a treat in anything he is in, with his cool demeanor and charm, and he is so well cast for the role of Winston. I was looking forward to seeing Mark Dacascos in this movie, and I am so glad that he is here, because he is really getting to prove his worth in a major blockbuster movie here, and he definitely should get rekognition for this movie. I am also glad to see Yayan Ruhian in a movie such as this, because with his martial arts skills he is worthy of movies such as this.I can honestly say that ""John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum"" is non-stop enjoyable action from start till end, and also comes with a good continuation of the story of the John Wick character. And needless to say, I am really looking forward to the fourth movie in the series.The action sequences in ""John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum"" were great and nicely choreographed and equally so executed on the screen. There is so much adrenaline in it and it feels like you are right there in the chaotic action yourself. I thoroughly enjoyed this aspect of the movie.While""John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum"" is not a movie that by any means challenges the intellect of the audience, it is definitely a movie that sweeps you off your feet and takes you along on an action-packed ride.If you've seen the previous two ""John Wick"" movies, you definitely need to watch ""John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum"". Trust me.",positive
"This film tells the story of an assassin who kills to evade being killed.The film is stylish and cool. The blood and violence is endless, and I can't even count how name people are killed. Honestly, towards the end I get a little bored by people getting killed. That said, the film is still an adventure that thrills and excites.",positive
"If you come to this for the much advertised fight choreography or exciting chase scenes, you will be disappointed. We've seen more exciting of each many times. There's no new ground here, no stunts in the Tom Cruise sense to speak of. No risks at all.Fightwise, the only novelty we have that is now already a brand is our character's damage that somehow transcends the challenges. So don't come for the action. Come for the world-building.It is astonishingly compelling, extended from the 'Godfather' tradition of 'rules and consequences'. It is comically extreme but consistent and logical. I can recommend this because of the thought that went into the creation of the world and the elaborate setup for the next film. That setup is tantalising.The idea that what keeps him going, pushes him through is personally attractive. He wants to live to remember his wife.",negative

"It's got the curse of the third movie, this - the script has been almost totally sacrificed for the imagery (which for the first 20 minutes is actually quite stunning). The fight scenes seem to go on and on well beyond the point where even Arnie would have been killed. Ian McShane is as wooden as usual; though this time we had (and missed) the chance to lock him in a huge safe. Laurence Fishburne brings a little gravitas to this, but otherwise it's just well beyond the pale, sorry.",negative

"JOHN WICK : CHAPTER 3 - PARABELLUM (2019) *** 1/2 Keanu Reeves, Halle Berry, Ian McShane, Laurence Fishburne, Mark Dacascos, Asia Kate Dillon, Lance Reddick, Tobias Segal, Anjelica Huston, Said Taghmaoui. Kick-ass continuation in the action franchise with laconic assassin-on-the run/dog lover Wick (Reeves having a helluva field day) facing immense odds on his life with practically EVERYONE out to kill him with a $14M bounty on his head. Proving that excessive violence never solved anything, the outrageous graphic violence is plentiful (um alert Guinness for record held in head shots alone!) and gleefully over the top absurd (a lethal fight has its victim reflect on just what a battle he's been in) and gainfully entertaining. Buckle up. (Dir : Chad Stahelski)",positive
"John Wick, having killed someone within the sanctuary of the New York Continental Hotel, is on the run with a $14M bounty on his head. We learn more about the High Table as their Adjudicator seeks to sanction those who have helped Wick: meanwhile Wick battles his way through the many, many, many, many anonymous figures who seek to kill him.Keanu Reeves kicks off Chpater 3 exactly where Chaper 2 left off, racing his pigeon-toed way through the streets of New York not quite ahead of the entire population, all of whom seem to know who he is as they wait, heavily armed, on the next corner.I liked John Wick 1. I thought number 2 was empty nonsense, non-stop videogame violence in search of a story. And, regrettably, number 3 is more of the same. I've scrolled through IMDB comments, through masses of 9s and 10s all declaring this to be the best yet, and how much better it is than anything else in cinemas at the moment. OK, fair enough, opinions are like fundamental orifices, everyone's got one, and what comes out of them is the same for each of us.But to me, the reason why this film fails (not completely, there was at least a little bit of story about the nature of the High Table) is because none of the exquisitely choreographed slaughter means anything. There are several reasons for this: 1. You can't hurt Wick. Stab him, run him over, throw him off a building - he just stands up, groans a bit, and carries on; 2. The number and manner of combatants is unbelievable. Wherever he is, there is an endless procession of assailants waiting to take their places in the queue of imminent corpses, usually 2 at a time. Pop, pop, another 2. 3. Assailants all have patented guaranteed to miss ammunition, Wick has patented guaranteed to hit ammunition. Yeah, right. 4. Knowing that you can't hurt him and he can kill you means that there is nothing at stake when he fights you - the result is predetermined. 5. The assailants are all faceless, anonymous bodies. They are not people, they are simply outlines in fairground tatget practice. There is no emotional significance to taking a life. These are not people, so who cares?Regrettably - because I like Keanu Reeves, this is empty-headed style over substance. No 9 or 10 from me, I'm afraid.",negative
"Just when I thought that John Wick had showed all his moves he goes into the bag of tricks and shows us some more super-awesome kill moves. Who thought watching killing could be so much fun? I know, it sounds awful when said like that but I speak nothing but the truth.Wick picks up in chapter three where he left off in chapter 2: a fugitive of the High Table. He has to A.) stay alive and B.) figure out a way out of being ex communicado. That's not really easy when you have a $14M bounty on your head.Maybe I'm being a creature of the moment but I think chapter three was the best of them all; or at least the most fun. Chapters one and two were enjoyable but in chapter three Wick made the art of killing humorous and enjoyable.With each successive chapter we learn more rules, see more characters, and find out more of how deep the hitman network goes. All of the little revelations keep the franchise fresh without being ridiculous. Put another way, it seems well thought out and not as though they just threw ideas against the wall and went with what stuck. I don't know how far this franchise will go but I see it going very far.",positive
"This film essentially begins where its predecessor left off with the renowned assassin ""John Wick"" (Keanu Reeves) being hunted by every hit-man and bounty hunter in the world who are eager to collect a $14 million reward put out for his violating the sacred principle of killing someone at a Continental hotel. Additionally, the fact that this person was a high-ranking member of an elite council known as the High Table also adds to his predicament. In any case, alone and heavily out-manned and out-gunned, John Wick realizes that instead of being the hunter he has become the hunted and that in order to survive he will have to defy the heavy odds and kill everyone that comes against him-and that number is staggering. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an entertaining movie for the most part but-unlike the two films before it-it lacked both character development and an in-depth and realistic plot. Likewise, I thought Halle Berry (as ""Sofia"") was badly miscast as well. Even so, while I don't believe this film was nearly as good as its predecessors, I thought it was still worth watching and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",positive
"Greetings again from the darkness. Worlds are colliding! No, no ... not in the way of ""The Avengers"" movies, but it's kind of hard not to smile when Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne share a scene (or two) in a mini-reunion of THE MATRIX. Mr. Reeves and director Chad Stahelski are back for a third time, and somehow they manage to raise the bar yet again on the fight sequences. And let's face it, the fighting and action are why so many are drawn to this franchise. This latest entry runs 2 hours and 10 minutes, and almost every bit is a frantic chase scene or violent fight ... or both.The film picks up mere moments after JOHN WICK: CHAPTER 2 ended. If you recall, John had killed a member of the High Table inside the Continental Hotel, an unforgivable break in the treasured rules. Winston (Ian McShane), the manager of the hotel, has given his friend a one hour head start prior to issuing the ""excommunicado"". It's that order (and the $14 million bounty) that sends every assassin on the planet on Wick's trail.No need to wait for the good stuff ... the film's first two fight sequences are extraordinary feats of stunt coordination, and consume the first 15-20 minutes. Here is what John Wick (and we viewers) are in for: Guns (many kinds), lots of knives, a hatchet, swords, a book, enough broken glass to fill a recycle center, horses, motorcycles, cars, every martial art known to man, highly trained dogs, a public library, a museum/collectibles display, a stable, and a ballet theatre complete with dancers. There is even a current NBA player, 7'3"" Boban Marjonovic, who battles John Wick and ultimately learns books can be used for something other than reading.John Wick's background is revealed, and his general level of tiredness reaches exhaustion, which actually adds an element to a character who is quite efficient with his conversation. There are a few people who are called on to help Wick, in particular we have Laurence Fishburne as the Bowery King, Anjelica Huston as the Ballet Director, and Halle Berry as Sophia, a former assassin who now runs the Continental Hotel in Morocco. See, even an underworld crime syndicate promotes from within. The segment with Sophia is one of the most fun, and it's not because of Ms. Berry. Rather her beautiful and highly-trained dogs are scene stealers who are devastating in their commitment to carry out orders.Other characters of interest include Asia Kate Dillon (""Billions"") as the Adjudicator, one who enjoys doling out punishment; Mark Dacascos (Wo Fat in ""Hawaii 5-0) as Zero, the ultimate Wick fanboy who wants nothing more than to be the one who kills him; Jerome Flynn (""Game of Thrones"") as Berrada, the senior official who doesn't negotiate fairly; Said Taghmaoui as The Elder from the High Table, who listens to Wick's proposal. Other supporting roles are filled admirably by Robin Lord Taylor, Jason Mantzoukas and Susan Blommaert. Of course, some of the most fun occurs again at The Continental Hotel as Reeves' Wick interacts with Lance Reddick and Ian McShane.From the department of ""Give 'em what they want"", the film has a very similar look, feel and tone to the first two, but director Stahelski (a standout stunt coordinator) and writers Derek Kolstad, Shay Hatten, Chris Collins, and Mark Abrams keep it fresh with new characters, new props and some terrific set design. The early model computers are contrasted with the high tech gadgetry of the Continental, and with a body count likely higher than the first two films combined, this entry can best be described as brutally entertaining ... is that even a thing? The violence is vivid and excessive and non-stop, and if that's not your style, you should at least know that the title is taken from the Latin ""Si vis pacem, para bellum"" - If you want peace, prepare for war.",negative
"After gunning down a member of the High Table, John Wick finds himself stripped of the organisation's protective services.Now with a $14 million bounty on his head, Wick must fight his way through the streets of New York as he becomes the target of the world's most ruthless killers.Parabellum is one of the most zen like action films ever made. Its psychedelic cinematography and mise en scene is what makes this franchise stand out from other action films, and it also cements Reeves as one of the most iconic screen presences there is working in cinema today.He says very little in the film, but action speaks louder than words, and my goodness, what sublime action there is in this beautiful film.Picking up straight from JW2, Parabellum is an almost exhausting exercise in action, and you have to empathise with Wick, he rarely has a chance to rest during the film, and the physical and psychological damage he suffers only adds to the films tension.Part 3 ups the ante with the set pieces, from the small intimate ones in a library, to the grand extended almost balletic extended shootouts in the second and third act, John Wick never fails to amaze the viewer, but with all this action, when we stop to breathe, especially when we have exposition starring Berry and Huston, the film really does stop in a jarring way.Camerawork is wonderful, particularly when we are on the road, with the camera focusing on the long road, subliminally referencing Wicks never ending journey, just when will it all be over? How will this man ever rest? Will Wick ever get to the end of his journey, his goal to carry on living, so he can remember?It's also great to see Dacascos starring in a major release again, his Zero is a formidable adversary, but his strange, almost camp like ways make him a very likeable presence, causing the viewer to let their guard down, and endear to him, making him one of the most dangerous villains.It's a wonderfully crafted film, almost dreamlike in its nature, the desert scene is awe-inspiring and a genuine jaw dropping moment, that lets you almost feel the delusional state Wick must be feeling as he slowly dehydrates.It's also very funny in places, with Macshane providing the biggest laugh by simply putting a phone down.So all in all, it's a wonderful sequel, thanks to Reeves hypnotic presence, the amazing choreography, and some wonderful camerawork.One cannot wait to see how the next film will top this.",positive
"It's 2003 and America is making the case to go to war with Iraq. Katharine Gun (Keira Knightley) is a British intelligence translator in GCHQ. They secretly listen in on communications around the world. Everybody gets an email ordering them to work with the Americans to dig up dirt on other UN Security Council states and push them to pass a war vote. Katharine is shocked. Despite the powerful Official Secrets Act, she risks everything to leak the damaging memo to the public. Journalist Martin Bright (Matt Smith) breaks with his paper's endorsement of the war to publish the article as the power of the state bears down upon Katharine and her refugee husband.I am surprised at the tension of this movie. It helps that I remember a little of the story but not its outcome for Katharine. One thing that frustrated me early on is the attitude of the husband. Without any insights into his character, he can come off as a callous clueless buffoon. The movie needs to lay out his situation from the beginning so that the audience can appreciate his point of view. The other minor issue is the title. It is the blandest of titles. The book's title ""The Spy Who Tried to Stop a War"" would be vastly better. This movie has lots of tension as a thriller and loads of insight into war creating.",negative
"Keira Knightley is a 'listener' for GCHQ, the British spy agency that listens in on phone conversations. All of the news is about the forthcoming Iraqi war, and she spends a lot of time shouting at the TV whenever Tony Blair is on. One day a memo comes through: the CIA is looking for stuff to blackmail members of the UN Security Council, so they'll vote more sanctions on Iraq, justifying an invasion by the U.S. and Britain. So she leaks the memo, in defiance of the Official Secrets Act. Eventually, the close and constant quizzing of her colleagues gets to her and she marches in and confesses she was the leaker.It's an unlikely story: so much so, I find it unbelievable except that it seems to be true. In fact, it's a very well told told, with good actors (Matthew Goode, Ralph Fiennes, Matt Smith, Rhys Ifans). What it is not is a movie, with its low-level lighting, limited focal depth, fixed camera and compositions that scream out that, yes, this is being shown in a wide-screen format on the movie screen, but it's set up so you can cut off the edges for standard TV composition without losing anything.In short, take a look at it when it shows up on TV. It's worth your time. It's just not the thing to pay to go to a movie theater for.",negative
"Official Secrets is a British/American co-production mostly in the English language and this (already) award-winning film is the most recent directorial effort by South African BAFTA nominee Gavin Hood (Tsotsi). He is also one of the writers because he and the Goldsteins adapted the book into a screenplay of 110 minutes here. The big star at the center of it all is Keira Knightley and I like her, so I am glad her career is still heading in the right direction after her Oscar nominations really happened a long time ago already. But maybe she can sneak in for a third time with this film. Time will tell. I think she played her part really well and proved without a doubt that she is still among the best the UK has to offer in terms of actresses under the age of 40. Plus she is only 3 months younger than me, so basically my age. Here she plays Katharine Gun and before I get too much into detail explaining who Mrs. Gun is and why she did what she did, let me just say she is basically the British female equivalent to Mr. Edward Snowden. This summarizes the premise really well I would say and I will talk a bit more later on about everything that happens after she becomes a whistleblower. But as for the film, it needs to be said that you will probably recognize more faces. Matthew Goode I like as always, even if he was a bit tough to identify at times here. Former Doctor Who Matt Smith I am not really that big on, but that is just personal taste. Rhys Ifans is also easy to identify as always. And then there is Ralph Fiennes, who plays a major supporting character in the second half of the film, namely the main character's lawyer. He is a big name obviously, so he is the only one who gets scenes without Knightley's character too because he has the star potential. We see him outside with his wife in the nature and at the very end it is even him who gets the final scene when he is fishing and talking to a man who is his friend as well as rival.But now back to Knightley. I must admit I struggled a bit with the film early on. The introduction, so basically everyhing before her really getting the document out did not impress me too much. They were basically showing us her family, her friends and, most importantly, her political attitude and how she disagrees considerably with (then) Prime Minister Tony Blair's foreign policy. It was too much of the same I would say. And when the character is screaming at the television, it almost felt a bit too much and slightly cringeworthy and I thought about that more than about her dedication. Glad her husband saw it the same. But luckily, the film gets better and better afterwards. I could mention so many scenes and moments that had me on the edge of my seat. Be it the actual act when she prints the email. The interrogation. The moment she goes in there and confesses to help out her friend. The relationship with her husband. The moment when her husband is forced to leave the country. The legal ideas she discusses with Fiennes' character. The Scotland Yard fellows. The idea that she is not allowed to talk about her job. And finally of course the moment at court. Which is really nothing but a moment with what happens there. Now that was totally unexpected. I guess in my personal case it also helped that here in Germany, there simply wasn't as much talk about her as there was about Snowden or Assange for example, so I did not know if she would get convicted. But the actual explanation that in order to convict her, they would have to expose highly classified government documentation that could really cause a lot more harm potentially than Gun (funny this is her name) getting free. Very smart, very well done.So mission accomplished for the filmmakers here. I enjoyed the watch and I also learnt quite a bit here and I am certainly curious too see what Gun has done since then. So don't be distracted by the sub-par beginning when it comes to this film. Keep watching. You will not regret it at all. At this point, I would say it is one of my top5 2019 movies and maybe the best political thriller I have seen all year. Really nice that there are new developments happening constantly, so that we get films like these based on actual events. Obviously, there is a lot fictionalizing in here, but it doesn't matter. At its core, it is based on real events and characters. I would even say that I enjoyed this film as much as I enjoyed Spotlight a few years ago and as the latter won Best Picture at the Oscars, that certainly means quite something. Now, this one here will definitely not achieve the same, but I am positive it will get a great deal of awards recognition nonetheless. The subject is definitely one in terms of political contents and political spectrum that (liberal) awards bodies will eat up immediately and I am sure this film will score many many BAFTA nominations, perhaps also get in once or twice at the Oscars. I mean there are many many Brits at the Academy. As for the acting, nobody has a real chance except Knightley and it would be nice if she manages. Fiennes definitely won't. He is solid as always and the epitome of a supporting character, like really supporting the protagonist, but the material is simply not baity enough, even if he was smartly written. Oh yeah, fans of the television series Episodes will also be positively surprised here. It was kinda baffling really because I thought the scene before Tamsin Greig actually showed up that she would be a good casting decision for that other female character working for the non-profit lawyer's office. Okay, I am sure that if it wasn't like 10 hours already almost since I watched the movie I could make a few more statements and comments on specific scenes, but there really is no need to because you will see the makers' attention to detail constantly when watching this movie. And you should definitely go for it. I highly recommend checking it out. Big thumbs-up.",positive
"Official Secrets might be based on a true story. It never musters any energy to be an effective thriller.Instead this is a glorified television movie. A drab docudrama on the run up to the second invasion of Iraq by western forces in 2003.Keira Knightley unglams and gives a muted performance as Katharine Gun, a translator at GCHQ in Cheltenham. Having come across an email that showed the American government were bugging the United Nations offices of six countries that could swing a UN Security Council resolution to invade Iraq.Gun who opposed the impending war, broke the Official Secrets Act and gave the email to a friend in the anti war movement who in turn passed it own to a journalist at the Observer newspaper.Eventually Gun is charged and her Kurdish husband is at risk of deportation.The nature of the true events means this is a plodding drama. Like an infamous dossier released by the then Labour government in the run up to the war. This could had done with some sexing up.Gun actually is portrayed as someone who is a bit dim rather than some crusader. The newspaper scenes are more effective.",negative
"This is an interesting true story other than Kiera Knightly doesn't look anything like Katherine Gun, but did star in The Imitation Game. While working for GCHQ in 2003 she discovers a top-secret memo from the US wanting help in gathering blackmail information on UN Security Council members who might vote against the war in Iraq. Such a vote was necessary for Britain to go to war. The film has her disclose the memo, it goes to the London Observer who attempts to verify it as The Drudge Report claims the authentic memo is false. (How can one guy be 100% wrong 100% of the time?)There wasn't much courtroom drama and in fact, we knew that she would fail and we would go to war. It is interesting to see how things operated. The story was well done. Well acted. But even still wasn't much of a film.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",negative
"Well when I say you, I don't mean the dear viewer of the movie (hopefully), but those who were entangled in a cover up. Something that came to light anyway, but how and when might be a different story. Or not, depending on how much you are aware of - what happened in real life.This is not a documentary though, so I can't attest to what was heightened for the film and its purposes to entertain and build suspense. Still the overall thing and how some fights seem unwinable ... it takes a toll while watching for sure. Keira Knightley is really good in this and overall the acting is great. The story is a ""bummer"", but that's life, isn't it?",negative
"The true life story of a woman who put the truth before career and personal life. The true life story of Katharine Gun, the brave young woman who leaked a document, telling us exactly what was happening in Iraq.It's a terrific film, it focuses on a story which for many is still hard to swallow. It's such an exciting movie, crammed with tension, as a political story you may expect it to be slow, it isn't.The performances are superb, Kiera Knightley is fantastic as Katharine, Ralph Fiennes and Matt Smith are also on point.IMDb is a platform for reviewing films and shows, it's a terrific site, and not the place for my political views. I'll just leave this, this is the first time I've not switched off something featuring Tony Blair.Great film, 8/10.",positive
"This movie has me revising my opinion on the legality of the Iraq War, so that by itself says the story was effectively told. Still, if governments lie, you can also ask yourself what agenda film makers have when they release a movie like this. And if I'm willing to have my opinion changed about a particular historical event, then what does that say about the information overload that comes one's way from other various sources. Somewhere in there is the fake news we should all be concerned about. What's remarkable to me after all was said and done, was how the British government dropped their case against Katharine Gun (Keira Knightley) to avoid the notoriety the exposé would bring, not to mention the unrealistic prospect of getting a conviction. The irony of the story for me is the repeatedly mentioned name without ever seeing the face of the man named Frank Koza, the NSA's Head of Regional Targets in the U.S. In Polish, the word 'koza' means 'goat', and I couldn't help thinking that the description totally fit for a guy who's blanket e-mail to an entire staff at GCHQ wound up being the basis for the entire whistle blower enterprise.",positive
"My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. No extras on the disc, just the movie, although we see a short glimpse of the real Ms Gun at the end as credits roll.This appears to be a British movie, filmed in England with British actors, but it is based on a book by an American husband and wife team, then the script was written by a different American husband and wife team. It traces true events when in 2003 the US and England were working to get justification to attack Iraq, depose Saddam Hussein, and free the Iraq people. I remember that year well, it turned out to be ""weapons of mass destruction"" which eventually was proven false.Keira Knightley is the British spy analyst, Katharine Gun. She (and others) find an email which appears to be a request to essentially use blackmail as a way to get other countries to agree so such an attack would not be considered a war crime. She is uncomfortable with this, she sees it as illegal, she gets a copy of the note in the hands of a journalist.This is a very nicely told story, showing the behind the scenes activities and British law which intended to prosecute Gun for revealing classified information.",positive
"Official Secrets is a true story about a woman, Katherine Gun, working for the British government. One day she sees a memo from the US and realizes that Bush and Blair want to go after Saddam Hussein and not the person behind 9/11, Osama bin Laden, and that they need to somehow get 9 votes from the UN. By hook or by crook. And since it's the government, it's by crook.Very upset, Katherine shows the memo to a friend who knows journalists. She hopes there will be an investigation. The next thing she knows, the memo is plastered all over the front page of a newspaper. As her colleagues are suspected and questioned, Katherine admits she is the leak and is arrested. And she refuses to plead guilty.This is an amazing film about a woman who is angered by the idea that thousands of people will be killed in an illegal and unnecessary war. Keira Knightley does a tremendous job of capturing the fear, the misery, and the bravery of Katherine Gun, with pressure coming at her to plead not guilty, attempts to deport her husband, and making her wait months to find out whether or not she will be charged.Knightley has wonderful support from Ralph Fiennes, Matthew Goode, Matthew Smith, Adam Bakri, and others.In today's world, it's great to see a true story of someone with integrity, since there is so little of it today. Highly recommended.",positive
This film tells the story of a woman with remarkable courage and morality. The story is so engaging that every single part of my body and brain wants her to have a happy ending. Tears flow down uncontrollably during the ending. It's a great film.,positive
"I think it is difficult for an actor to portray a living subject that was (in the UK, anyway) subject to such public scrutiny at the time of an investigation - objectively. There is always the temptation to sensationalise and/or glorify their activities. In this film, though, Keira Knightley does rather pull it off - her dowdy, ordinary, look coupled with a tight screenplay and some good supporting performances from Adam Bakri (who was good in ""Omar"") and Ralph Fiennes left me feeling sympathies with her truth agenda in a way that some of the more recent, bigger-budget films (""The Report"" being the most recent) didn't. It is a little slow at times and the characterisation of the newspaper journalists lacked any semblance of sophistication. The topic will divide opinion for years to come, but this provides for an interesting discourse on personal v national priorities, values and choices.",positive
"Normally I endure rather than enjoy any film that features Keira Knightly and there's usually a solid reason other than Knightly, like the writer - Tolstoy, anyone - but here she is much easier to take possibly because she is portaying a real person who is still very much alive leaving little or no room for her 'look at me, mummy, I'm actually not only getting paid but also getting top billing with no discernible talent to justify either' trope. Again, surrounded by real actors who make her look competent minimum demands are made on her limited-to-non-existent thespic abilities. For a dialogue heavy film it's relatively painless.",positive
"Greetings again from the darkness. Doing the right thing is usually pretty easy. However a person's true character is revealed when it's not so easy. In 2003, doing the right thing became very difficult for Brit Katharine Gun. How difficult? Well, her decision could jeopardize her job. It's a decision that could get her husband deported. Making the choice could expose two powerful international governments and send her to prison for many years. And if that's not enough risk, how about a decision that could lead to a huge (possibly illegal) war, costing thousands of lives? So you know what Katharine Gun did? She did the right thing.Keira Knightley stars as Katharine Gun. The film opens in 2004 with her facing a British court and the moment of her plea. We then flashback one year to see Katharine working as a staff member of GCHQ (Government Communications Headquarters). She spends her days translating and compiling intelligence for the British Government. It's a job that requires the utmost discretion and the contractual obligation to keep work secrets at work. One day she reads a top secret memo making it clear that governments were conspiring to manipulate a United Nations vote required to authorize an invasion of Iraq.Based on the (lengthy titled) book ""The Spy who Tried to Stop a War: Katharine Gun and the Secret Plot to Sanction the Iraq Invasion"" by Martha Mitchell and Thomas Mitchell, the film is directed by Gavin Hood (the excellent TSOTSI, 2005) who co-wrote the screenplay with Gregory Bernstein and Sara Bernstein. It's presented as a moral quandary for Katharine. Say nothing and maintain the status quo in her personal and professional life, or speak up and risk everything noted above. We see Katharine's impulsive decision-making, and behavior that would rank her among history's least likely successful spies. It's actually her naivety that guides her to speak up.The media side is also addressed here, and although some terrific actors are involved, this segment is the film's slickest and least realistic. Matt Smith plays political reporter Martin Bright and Rhys Ifans plays Ed Volliamy. The two journalists for ""The Observer"" worked together to verify the memo leaked by Ms. Gun, and Matthew Goode is Peter Beaumont, the editor who pushed to run the story. Previously, the paper had been an avid supporter of British Prime Minister Tony Blair, and took many of their stories directly from information provided by his office. Running the story exposed the paper to scrutiny that it was not accustomed to.Where the film excels is in exploring Katharine's personal turmoil. It's also where it fails us as viewers. As her personal story, the subject matter is a unique and rare look at the wheels of government intelligence. Unfortunately, an inordinate amount of time is spent on the media and reporting, and not enough on what emotional torture the year of waiting must have been for her. Ralph Fiennes plays Ben Emmerson, the lead attorney for Liberty - the legal organization who takes on Katharine's case. It's the legal wranglings of this complex case that make for extraordinary drama, and the fallout of her personal choices had the potential for disaster. All of this is covered in a cursory manner, when more detail would have added more heft to a fascinating story. This includes her run-ins with an MI5 agent played superbly by Peter Guiness. The Official Secrets Act of 1989 is mentioned about 10 times, even though we understand pretty quickly that actions against this law likely results in treason. Ms. Gun is a hero for exposing illegal government activity, and a more intimate look at her personal turmoil would have provided more suspense and a better connection for the viewer.",negative
It is wonderful now that enough time has passed that movies are being made about the heroes and heroines who tried to stop the Iraq war and tragically failed. With such a good cast and the subject matter of whistle blowing how can this not be a good movie. That's why I couldn't believe negative reviews.The earlier part shows the doubt a whistle blower faces and the consequences on their lives. The latter part is very involving when they put together her defence and the shocking ending leaves such a wonderful feeling. Of course by then the WMD fiasco had already come to light.Keira is prettier here than in some of her other movies. She looks great with less makeup and less smiling. She acts well and when she delivers her justifications it's quite believable. She makes this movie watchable. Look out for a bevy of top actors from Ralph Fiennes as her lawyer to Matthew Goode with a bad crew cut and Matt Smith as a journalist.It's a timely look at whistle blowing and the tragedy of the Iraq War and a woman's journey from alleged traitor to heroine.,positive
"Hats off to director Gavin Hood for placing Gregory and Sara Bernstein's adaptation of the Marcia and Thomas Mitchell novel ""The Spy Who Tried To Stop A War: Katherine Gun and the Secret Plot to Sanction the Iraq Invasion' before the public in this excellent film - an act of bravery and commitment to truth.Kudos to the excellent cast also - Keira Knightley, Jeremy Northam, Matt Smith, Matthew Goode, Rhys Ifans, Ralph Fiennes, Indira Varma and all the supportive roles. Information such as this may be known to some - the 2003 debacle of the sanctioning of the invasion of Iraq exposed by whistleblower Katherine Gun as an illegal NSA spy operation - but seeing realized in such a skillful manner make the impact of this historical moment even more significant. The pacing of the film is on target, speedy but still allowing enough development of the individual characters involved to make the story all the more credible and fascinating.Films such as this are invaluable reminders of how governments can ill-function at times and how war is never an event to consider lightly. Recommended for all viewers.",positive
"If there is something to be learned from a biography/movie like Official Secrets is that we should have a immense respect for all kind of whistleblowers, people that risk everything just by exposing an ugly truth, a truth we are all allowed or should be obliged to know. Governments spying illegally on us, breaching our rights of privacy, twisting the truth and telling lies in order to better themselves or certain enterprises, it should all be made public and those whistleblowers should be rewarded instead of being put on trial. Official Secrets is a poignant story, very well shot, with a very good cast. Keira Knightley excels in playing her character Katharine Gun. For a crime drama it's one of the better ones, and being it based on a true story makes it even better. A must watch, certainly for all the sheep that think things like this don't happen on daily basis.",positive
"The tagline for promoting ""Official Secrets"" is ""nothing is more dangerous than the truth."" On the surface, the film is about the implications of the ""leaking"" of classified or top secret state documents, with many resonances to our current world. But, on a deeper level, the film is really about the theme of personal conscience and remaining true to the values of democracy.Keira Knightley is outstanding in playing the role of Katharine Teresa Gun, who leaked one critical document that showed to the world how the United States-British alliance in going to war with Iraq in 2003 was a sham. The most moving moment in the film is when we see briefly documentary footage of the real Katharine Gun, who took a stand on the changing of history.The film primarily focuses on Ms. Gun's work at the GCHQ (Government Communications Headquarters) and how she came to release to the public a top secret memorandum to the press. The reporter Martin Bright of ""The Observer,"" ultimately broke the story that was buttressed by the critical memo.Even with the story published by ""The Observer,"" the Deep State apparatus moved into high gear to rebut the findings of a dedicated journalist. The key historical moment of Colin Powell lying to the United Nations Security Council that Sadaam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction was the tipping point allowing the war to proceed.Ms. Gun was kept on ice for a year before charges were brought against her...and then dropped. By then, the war in Iraq was already under way and going badly. The British government wanted no part of a trial that would have demonstrated that the war was technically begun illegally through the machinations of Tony Blair and his government.Elizabeth Wilmshurst, deputy legal advisor to the foreign office, was prepared to testify in support of Ms. Gun. ""We were lied into an illegal war,"" was the contention of the defense for Ms. Gun. Lord Goldsmith, Wilmshurst's boss, went to Washington, D.C. under the assumption that the war would not be possible from Britain's perspective. But after meeting Rumsfeld and others, Goldsmith returned with a changed view. It was not until 2010 that Goldsmith's early advice to Tony Blair was made public: the war would have been illegal without a formal U.N. Security Council resolution.Eventually 151,000 to over one million Iraqis lost their lives in the war. 4,600 U.S-British lives were lost with thousands wounded. The United States is now teetering on bankruptcy with a multi-trillion-dollar defecit. Today, the phenomenon of leaking classified information in the American government is commonplace with officials like James Comey thus far suffering no legal consequences, while underlings like Edward Snowden are living in exile. This film raises untold possibilities for debating the nature of leaking, national security issues, and the shenanigans that seem all too familiar in the Deep State.",positive
"It's good, but formulaic, like all movies of this sort. I wonder whether the ultimate goal is to inspire people or to let them be brutally aware that leaking secrets relevant to public safety means that: entire governments will come after you and everyone you care aboutspecial laws will have been written for people like you that only apply to youreporters will check that the people involved exist (which will be denied on grounds of national security)reports will check that the info is real (which they will not legally have access to)the media organizations you contact will not have expressed an opinion opposite of what your information leads tothe media organizations and reporters you contact are not under surveillance themselvesthe media organizations and reporters you contact are not going to crack under pressurethe reporting itself will be allowed by the apparatus of lawyou have nothing to gain personally and everything to loseAnd every time someone succeeds, they pour unlimited resources to study the case and stop anything like that happen again. Luckily, state organizations are also incredibly bureaucratic, slow, nepotistic and inefficient. But imagine having this as the only positive reason to believe your government will not overstep or succumb to corruption.",positive
"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn 2003, Katherine Gun (Keira Knightley), an employee of GCHQ, came across sensitive information suggesting America was putting pressure on the British government to gather spurious information to justify the invasion of Iraq. Already a fierce opponent of any military intervention, Katherine found herself compelled to act, and leaked information of this news to The Observer newspaper. When she was forced to reveal herself as the leaker, Katherine was plunged into a devastating spiral of events that threatened to rip her life apart.It's a depressing moment when things you can remember happening very clearly at a fully developed point in your life have suddenly happened a very long time ago, and now have some kind of historical context to them. Even though the invasion of Iraq happened sixteen years ago, when I was a much younger man, considering the course of time that modern films can still engagingly cover, it's a pretty recent thing, and definitely one that there's still loads of interest in. And director Gavin Hood has seized upon that with this dramatization of a 'whistle blower' who was instrumental in exposing how corrupt the whole thing was.Despite a pretty slow and dull beginning, that makes it feel more suited to a Sunday afternoon TV drama than a big screen affair, it gradually develops into something more riveting and compelling, really delving into all the juicy background corruption that went on behind our backs in the build-up to that war. Hood saturates the whole thing in a blurry, drained out camera style that allows for no respite from all the dramatic events unfolding. Knightley is reliably strong and commanding in the lead role, as a courageous young woman who pays a terrible price for confronting the powers that be, with stellar support from the likes of Matthew Goode, Ralph Fiennes, Matt Smith and Adam Bakri.This is the sort of adult, mature filmmaking people don't have so much time for these days, and will no doubt be out of theatres in no time, a shame since director Hood has delivered an impressive film, which, while not quite matching the nail biting tension of his previous military thriller Eye in the Sky, is still a shattering, uncomfortable indictment of how the state will persecute anyone who goes against it's wishes. ****",positive
"It's sometimes difficult for films that deal with heavy dialogue covering subjects that are not always the easiest to translate on screen to create thrilling 100 minutes or so. Official Secrets does it well, bolstered by yet another great (period piece) performance from Keira Knightley. This film may not be revered as much as All the President's Men or Spotlight but it's up there for me. Separating itself by showing the true costs of being a whistleblower emotionally and physically while still succeeding in using a similar formula structurally. I was nothing short of enthralled with Official Secrets.8.8/10",positive
"Greetings from Lithuania.I'm a real fan of Gavin Hood's movies since ""Rendition"" back in 2007. I really liked ""Tsotsi"", and then later highly enjoyed his ""Eye in the Sky"" - one of my favorite films of 2015. When this director makes thrillers - its a first rate stuff. Now comes ""Official Secrets"" which I really wanted to see because of this director. And this movie did not disappoint me to say the least. I highly enjoyed the story, which was true in this case. This movie was very involving, solidly acted and very solidly written and directed. Also I did know the outcome of this story, nor have heard about this person before, so it was really interesting to me know how it all turned out.Overall, ""Official Secrets"" works a as very good political thriller. Its skillfully crafted and I was involved into this movie for all running time. Great thriller.",positive
"This dramatized doc covered most of the talking points dealing w/the decision to start the Iraqi war, and the controversial media exposure of a secret document. Also, the ""creation"" of a rationale, later dismissed, of WMD (weapons of mass destruction, e.g. biological, chemical, nuclear). Even then we hear Trumpism-like, fodder-for-the-public, statements, ""You got to make your own facts."", and ""It's all for the American people."" Seen was footage of urban carpet bombing. Reminded me (in only a very small way) of the carpet bombing of Vietnam & neighboring countries. Iraqis killed/wounded 150,000 to 1,000,000+; Americans 30,000+; 'nuff said.",positive
"Some in the audience of ""Official secrets"" would be reminded of ""All the president's men"". But the former is strictly about whistle blowing, the latter, investigative journalism. While it is hard to imagine anyone not having heard of Watergate, the events in ""Official secrets"" are far less known, although details are all in the public domain for anyone to look up. ""All the president's men"" is triumphantly uplifting as you see justice done. ""Official secrets"" is in a way depressing, making you groan at the injustice.While our protagonist Katharine Gun's personal story may not be generally known, the subject matter is: the Iraq War in 2003. Although the dictatorship in the country was not exactly an innocent victim, it is generally recognized that this was not a war fought for just, but manufactured to satisfy the political agendas of the Western powers. The devastating collateral damage was the innocent Iraq civilian.Yet, there was a flicker of a chance that the war might have been stopped. There was a conspiracy of sorts to secure the votes in the UN to authorize the war. A critical document involving both the U.S. and the U.K., however, was leaked by our protagonist Gun, a translator at a spy agency of the U.K. The Observer published it which, for a brief shiny moment, was applauded by the world, embarrassing the two nations. Unfortunately, according to the movie, it is almost immediately discredited as a result of an absurd clerical mistake. A spell-check was used by a clueless clerk, changing the spelling of a couple of words of this U.S. document from American style to British style, thereby making it look like a fake. Gun was arrested under the ""Official Secrets Act"". Eventually she was not charged, but only being kept in a year of torturous suspense, a psychological if not a legal penalty. If you wish to know what happened after the time frame of the movie, Google is your friend.This movie is not commercially entertaining as ""All the president's men"" but it is not quite as dry as a dramatized documentary. The top-notch British cast is well worth watching. Kiera Knightley will have you rooting for Gun in no time at all. Playing the reporters are Matthew Goode, Rhys Ifans and Matt Smith (whom many of us know better as Prince Philip in ""The crown""). Heavyweight Ralph Fiennes plays Gun's defending lawyer. And I shall be remiss if I fail to mention to Game of Thrones fans that a relatively small part, the editor, casts Conleth Hill, otherwise known as Lord Varys.",negative
"I never knew about this story and the whistle-blower, but mad props to her and for the producers putting this film together. Great directing and cinematography, written and cast perfectly with outstanding performances by everyone especially Keira Knightley. Pacing was a little slow and some scenes should've been trimmed down a bit to make the 112 min run-time not feel so long. A well deserved 8/10 from me.",positive
"When you read my review for ""The Irishman"", please keep in mind that I am not a big fan of gangster movies nor am I a huge fan of director Martin Scorsese. It's not that I think the movies are terrible and I know that Scorsese is a great director...but I never would have even seen the film had it not been featured at the Philadelphia Film Festival this past October.The film is a very long saga about the live of Frank Sheeran, a real life mobster who brutally murdered quite a few people. At about 3.5 hours, the story did keep my interest...though I do think about 30 minutes could have been shaved off the story. This is my only complaint about the film....and it's minor. On the plus side, while the film is very violent, it's not as intensely violent as some of Scorsese's other pictures....though it's hardly in the category of his brilliant flop, ""Hugo""!",positive
"Elderly Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) in a nursing home recounts his life in the mob. He murders prisoners in WWII. He drives a truck and steals slabs of beef from the back. He is caught but he wins his trial. He is introduced to various mob bosses and befriends Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci). He becomes the right hand man of Teamsters president Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino).They don't make directors like Martin Scorsese anymore and they don't make movies like this anymore. Quite frankly, at two and a half hour, this may fit better as a TV mini-series. Only his name makes this a cinematic experience. While it is beautifully filmed, nothing really screams big screen. It is detailed and methodical. The problem is that it is a movie about a cold-hearted character. He is unmoved about his violent ways until the last act. His criminality is not fun. His brutality has no humanity. He is psychopath and not an enjoyable one. It is a movie from the past, by the past, and about the past. While I am in awe of the filmmaking expertise, I find the character has limited appeal. Scorsese is going over old grounds. His perfect movies have already been made. This can never exceed them.",negative
"The Irishman is a new 2019 American full feature film that is mostly in the English language and it is a really long movie at pretty much exactly 3.5 hours, so duration-wise basically two films together with each of them running 1 hour 45 minutes. But of course, it is just one film. Still I think it could have worked as a miniseries too. This film is based on a book and the adaptation is by Oscar winner Steven Zaillian (Schindler's List). The big star behind the camera, however, is the incomparable Martin Scorsese. I read people say this could be his final movie, but I really hope it is not. Not that he would not deserve retirement with all the greatness he has come up with in his career. This film here adds a new chapter to that. I am actually surprised to read that before teaming up with Netflix they struggled to find a production company here. I mean come on Scorsese and De Niro working on a mobster movie? Could it ever have gone wrong? Admittedly Pacino and Pesci (who celebrated some of his biggest successes, including his Oscar win, in Scorsese / De Niro films) probably weren't confirmed yet back then. So I would say it went right and looking at how this made it to the imdb top250 already immediately, others seem to agree. I must still say this is too much and I would not call it a great film really, even if there are occasional great moments. I will get to these later. But then again, my opinion is probably not too representative when it comes to Scorsese because the films that are considered his very best are not among my favorites from him and instead I prefer for example Hugo, Shutter Island or also the film about old Japan he made not too long ago (with Driver, Garfield and Neeson).Now as for this one here, I already mentioned the three key actors with De Niro being at the center of it all from beginning to end at different stages of his character's life. Pay attention to his bright blue eyes here. The two big supporting players do not have that much time together on the screen. Basically early on, it is Pesci mostly. Then Pacino steps into the picture and really takes over and Pesci is gone for a long time until he reappears in the film's final third. And at the end, Pacino is gone and it is again only Pesci until the very end, when it's all about De Niro. I must say these very final scenes in the last half hour were also when De Niro mostly shines. He was not that great or memorable before that really. I would even go so far to say that Pacino stole the spotlight from him a bit. And he was a real scene stealer. This of course also has to do with the material. Frequently he just has much more to work with. The scene when they meet the guy who is late and not properly dressed is the best example. Pure Oscar bait for Pacino. Admittedly, he really also makes the most of this. But I am not surprised that the way it seems now De Niro is not getting the Oscar nomination this year, but Pacino and Pesci are. Actually, from what I saw here, I would really love to see Pacino win his second, but at this point it seems highly unlikely because Pesci seems to be getting more momentum and both will have a hard time beating Brad Pitt, also because they will probably steal some votes from each other. Not that I'd mind Pitt winning at all. As for Pesci, the nomination is enough. But not undeserving. I think he pretty much showed a flawless performance here and also nailed all the more subtle moments, but as good as Pacino he is not or I would say his character did not offer as much. Speaking of awards, of course Scorsese must be mentioned too. Can he win Best Director this year? With his actors going against Pitt, he could be going mostly against Tarantino who directed Pitt. I am not sure, a nomination seems safe and he is among the top3 contenders right now. I don't think this is among his best directorial efforts though, so even if I love the man it would be too much and it would be nicer if he finally gets his second directing Oscar for another film in the future. We will see.Also I want to say a few words on specific scenes and characters here. First of all, it must be said of course that this is based on actual events and characters. The best example is how the protagonists perceive the Kennedy assassination, especially Pacino's with the American flag scene. And as almost always with Scorsese there is a great deal of bloodshed in here. It all leeds to the killing of Hoffa. Maybe you knew it would happen, maybe you didn't. But still seeing it happen at the hands of Sheeran was rough, even if it was just one quick glimpse, two bullets and he was dead. But consequences were grave. Media posted hourly updates about the search for Hoffa and for Sheeran himself, this also had very personal consequences, namely his daughter seeing what happened. I am not too sure if I liked it and it felt realistic that she realized it, but the ""why?"" ""why what?"" moment was really tense. Oscar winner Anna Paquin plays the dauughter by the way. And with this scene alone, her character was probably more relevant or played a bigger role in this film than all the protagonists' wives who admittedly added very little except cigarette smoke. Also the scene very early on with the daughter and what happens after her dad finds out a guy pushed her in a store. She realizes how violent he can be and it is not only when he needs to protect his beloved ones. Another daughter makes a similar statement at the very end because when something happened they could not talk about it to their father because his reaction would be so over the top. But despite all the violence, bullets to the head etc. there are also scenes and moments that will make you laugh a little but, such as the lengthy fish scene at the end, or the gun graveyard earlier, Hoffa's sweet tooth when it comes to ice cream. And there is more really.In general, it is a film about many subjects, not just about crime, father-daughter relationships etc. but also for example about real honest friendship because Bobby's and Pesci's characters are friends for life really in here, even if they are also business associates. That's surely what you can call them. In addition, the music is always nice in Scorsese films and this is no exception. I personally found it pretty nice to see Breaking Bad's Jesse Plemons in here, even if he did not have too much to work with this time. But it's kinda interesting how he is having a far better career than Aaron Paul and without the Oscar nomination maybe he'd even be vlose to Bryan Cranston. And for me personally, it was really amazing to see J.C. MacKenzie here, even if it is just one or two scenes, because I loved him since Dark Angel. These likes are personal taste for me. Maybe others will appreciate Huston, Lombardozzi or Cannavale, it's up to you. Overall I believe if you consider watching this one, you most likely have seen older Scorsese crime films, or mobster movies in general, so you don't really need me to give you a recommendation here. But if you do, it would not be a negative one, although I cannot be as enthusiastic about this film as I would like to be. Still, thumbs-up. go watch and you will find many interesting details that maybe I have not mentioned already like the very last camera last shot with the door open, just like Hoffa's was the first time the two met.",positive
"The Irishman is really a great film. When the viewer watches a movie with 3h 29min running time and does not stop or take a nap it is an indication that the film is attractive and holds the attention. The screenplay is excellent, disclosing in flashbacks the life of the gangster Frank Sheeran performed by Robert De Niro. Martin Scorsese is certainly one of the best directors of Mafia films. The cast with the veteran Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Joe Pesci and Harvey Keitel is the indication of maybe the best in the genre in the contemporary world. The effects in the make-up are amazing and it is hard to know who they are in the present days. In the end, ""The Irishman"" is certainly one of the best (if not the best) production by Netflix. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""O Irlandês"" (""The Irishman"")",positive
"The Irishman is a companion piece to Martin Scorsese's other gangster films, Goodfellas and Casino.It is also a teaming up of his old pals for one last ride. Robert De Niro has not appeared in a Scorsese film since Casino. Neither has Joe Pesci who basically retired from the movies in 1998. Harvey Keitel last worked with Scorsese in The Last Temptation of Christ. Al Pacino is the new boy, his first time working with Scorsese.The Irishman is less violent than Goodfellas and Casino. It still packs a punch although Scorsese has been more careful not to make these gangsters look as glamorous as in his previous films.Spanning 40 years, Frank Sheeran (De Niro) recalls his story. A World War 2 veteran who fought in Italy, a truck driver who delivered meat who went on to become a man who painted houses (a hitman.) Sheeran got involved with Russell Bufalino (Pesci) a Pennsylvania gangster who kept a low profile. It brings him into contact with Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino) the leader of the powerful Teamster union who loaned money from its pension fund to organized crime. Sheeran went on to become close with Hoffa and a union organiser.Scorsese has called The Irishman a chamber piece. It is mainly about its three main characters and only De Niro, Pesci and Pacino go through the digital de-aging process. They are made to look in their late 30s/40s for the early part of the film.The film has the best cinema performances that De Niro and Pacino have given in years, mainly because the quality of some scripts they have been offered have been far from the best. Pacino plays Hoffa differently from Jack Nicholson in the movie Hoffa. Pacino's interpretation is of a man who likes ice cream sundaes, hates tardiness and unwilling to see reason because he thought the Teamsters owed him the leadership as a right. Pesci in contrast with his volatile Goodfellas character is a more thoughtful wiseguy here.The film clocks in at three and half hours. It is too long and one hour could had easily been excised from it. The de-aging has been done sympathetically. It works mainly because we are never told how old they were when we see them at their younger age. However, you can make an actor in his 70s look thirty years younger, you cannot digitally make them move like younger men. You can spot De Niro gingerly climbing some rocks in one scene.The treatment of females in this movie is superficial. Sheeran's and Bufalino's wives are just there to chain smoke. Only Sheeran's daughter Peggy shows unhappiness as to her father's chosen profession. Even then the old Peggy is wasted. At one point I did wonder why the film had a de-aged Holly Hunter playing Peggy. Only to realise she was played by Anna Paquin, who won an Oscar for playing Hunter's daughter in The Piano.Despite the reservations, Scorsese has crafted a wonderful film, getting together the actors he relied on from his own early days as a director. There is an air of elegiac nostalgia to a style of cinema that might be passing away which Scorsese reflected on with his comments about Marvel superhero films. Ironic that The Irishman only got a limited cinema release as its main platform is Netflix.",positive
"There is much to admire in this film just from the names involved alone - on paper it looked terrific due to the amount of talent coming together to make the film, and that it is in a world where similar combinations of people have made classics before. The use of de-aging technology added to the reasons to talk about the film before it was out, and generally there was a lot of hype around it. In the key areas that matter, it lives up to the hype. The narrative unfolds slowly and has lots of moving parts and jumps around in time, but it is compelling throughout; I thought I'd watch this split over two nights but in the end the film passed really quickly despite how incredibly long it is.From the very start it roots itself in old age, in reflection, and it uses this approach very well. Where Goodfellas was youthful energy and excitement, The Irishman has a much different tone in the way it is melancholic throughout, and how it lets us breathe around the characters. De Niro's lead is excellent at this; it is a very muted performance but his numbness to violence is consistently portrayed. The final scenes in particular are not ones of guilt or regret, but just numbness with a tinge of fear; the loneliness of it all is what is striking, and how much of it he is feeling. Similarly Pesci is very understated and his character is played consistently; when he is in business he is silent and threatening just by his presence, and I liked that the film took the time to show that this was not something he could switch on/off - with the daughter he was unintentionally 'off' in his communication and manner. The daughter scenes also allows Pacino to show us that he was a more genuine character by virtue of making that connection with her. Okay he is 'full Pacino' here but his noise and energy makes him stand out from the 'real' threats - he convinces in the nuance of someone who thinks he is in this world, but ultimately is not.In terms of structure and direction, the film looks and sounds great, and is edited together in a way that moves through time and places but makes perfect sense in content and flow. All the elements click - for instance the wardrobe and sets are a big part of the film keeping the viewer informed about where we are. In terms of the much discussed technology, it is impressive, but the most impressive thing was that I didn't notice it very often. Mostly I just took it at face value that this is what the person looks like, much like I do whenever someone has really good make-up for the same effect. Here and there it looked a little odd, but it was never a big problem, only a positive.The length may put some off, but it is a benefit that it was on Netflix, because it is easier at home with breaks and self-pacing if needed. I didn't need it as I found the story-telling and the use of the many talents involved all produced a great film which has violence, an engaging story, sadness, reflection, and a very real sense of a sunset.",positive
"The reality of the film's luster is beginning to settle in I think. When it first came out, I believe it was tracking in the mid 130's on the IMDb Top 250, and has now settled into the #208 position as I write this. It will most likely drop out of the Top 250 at some point in 2020. That's not to say it isn't a good film. It is, but doesn't merit the hype surrounding it as potentially the best picture of the year. It certainly doesn't surpass director Scorsese's prior gangster epics, 1990's ""Goodfellas"" or 2006's ""The Departed"". The movie is based on the book by a former alleged Mafia hitman titled ""I Heard You Paint Houses: Frank ""The Irishman"" Sheeran and Closing the Case on Jimmy Hoffa"". The painting houses reference can be considered mob code parlance for 'I heard you kill people', which is what brought Sheeran to the attention of crime boss Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci). The book's validity has been questioned, thus putting the film's narrative into the same scope of reimagining as this year's ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"", Quentin Tarantino's take on the Charles Manson family's murder rampage in Los Angeles in 1969.I've read some disparaging accounts of the de-aging process used in the film to make Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci look younger. If one is intent on finding fault, I guess you could, but I thought the effect for all three was remarkably well done. It goes the other way too when the actors are made to look much older, especially with Pesci. Considering the type of film this is, I was taken aback a bit by the seemingly lack of vulgarity in the dialog among the mobsters as they conducted day to day business. There is some, but considering Pesci's use of the 'f' word in other films while raising it's use to an art form, the tone of the language in the picture is surprisingly kept to a minimum.The story of Hoffa and the unions is presented in context with the political climate of the eras in which the story takes place, with particular emphasis on the short presidency of John F. Kennedy. The seminal events of that period are all given sway, with mentions of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and of course, Kennedy's assassination. The enmity that developed against the Kennedy's after the mob's help in getting JFK elected is touched upon, with references to Chicago gangland boss Sam Giancana. Knowing a bit of history about the Mafia and it's tentacles into the government would be of help in understanding some of the scenarios presented in the story.There are some interesting cameos in the picture, most notably by Harvey Keitel as gangster Angelo Bruno, and Steve Van Zandt as lounge singer Jerry Vale. Ray Romano has a somewhat larger role as mob lawyer Bill Bufalino, and it's a treat seeing him in a non-comedic role as he was quite effective. When things get down to the wire regarding Jimmy Hoffa's (Pacino) intention to muscle his way back into the Teamsters presidency, one has to read between the lines of the various mob figures who decide that Hoffa's time has passed and the need to move on becomes apparent. That is, until the picture's single most shocking twist moment occurs with Frank Sheeran's (De Niro) loyalty to Russell Bufalino going unquestioned.Overall, a good film, and I'm sure it will garner it's share of award nominations, but you should probably temper expectations against the media hype. Fans of the principals might find it better than those who are not, which also can be said for director Scorsese. In any event, check it out and decide for yourself. The Netflix option gives one the opportunity to take a mid-film break, as the length of the picture might leave you feeling antsy with some of the slower exposition.",positive
"This film produced by Netflix was a reunion for Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Martin Scorsese (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, The Wolf of Wall Street) and leading actor De Niro and supporting actor Pesci have worked together in 24 years, since Casino, and one that was getting attention during Awards Season. Basically, elderly World War II veteran Frank ""The Irishman"" Sheeran (Robert De Niro) is in a nursing home, he recounts his time as a hitman for powerful criminal families and mobsters. In 1950s Philadelphia, Sheeran works as a delivery truck driver and starts to sell some of his shipment contents to local gangster Felix ""Skinny Razor"" DiTullio (Bobby Cannavale). After his company accuses him of theft, union lawyer Bill Bufalino (Ray Romano) gets him off. Bill introduces Sheeran to his cousin Russell Bufalino (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Joe Pesci), head of the Northeastern Pennsylvania crime family. Sheeran begins to do jobs for Russell and members of the local South Philadelphia underworld, including ""painting houses,"" a euphemism for murder. Soon, Russell introduces Sheeran to Jimmy Hoffa (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Al Pacino), head of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, head of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, who has financial ties with the Bufalino crime family and is struggling to deal with fellow rising nominee Anthony ""Tony Pro"" Provenzano (Stephen Graham). Hoffa becomes close with Sheeran and his family, especially his daughter Peggy, and Sheeran becomes Hoffa's chief bodyguard. After the 1960 election of John F. Kennedy, Sheeran is tasked with delivering weapons for the CIA in their failed attempt to overthrow the Cuban government. Kennedy's brother, Robert F. Kennedy, named the Attorney General, forms a ""Get Hoffa"" squad to try and bring down Hoffa, who is arrested and convicted for jury tampering in 1964. While Hoffa is in prison, his replacement, Frank ""Fitz"" Fitzsimmons (Gary Basaraba), overspends union pension funds and makes interest-free loans to the Mafia. Hoffa's relationship with Provenzano, himself arrested for extortion, also deteriorates beyond repair. Hoffa has his sentence commuted by President Richard Nixon in 1971, but he is forbidden from partaking in any Teamsters activities until 1980. Despite his parole terms, Hoffa undertakes a plan to reclaim his power. Russell becomes concerned with Hoffa's growing disrespect for other Teamster leaders and crime families. Sheeran is honoured at a special dinner in 1973, he asks Hoffa to present the award to him onstage. Russell tells Sheeran to confront Hoffa and warn him about his behaviour displeasing the heads of the crime families. Hoffa informs Sheeran that he ""knows things"" that Russell and others are unaware of, he claims that he is untouchable, for if anything ever happened to him, they would all end up in prison. In 1975, while on their way to the wedding of Bill's daughter, Russell tells Sheeran that the dons have become fed up with Hoffa and have sanctioned his murder. Russell reluctantly tells Sheeran that he has been chosen as the man to kill, fearing he may otherwise warn or save Hoffa. Hoffa, who had scheduled a meeting at a local diner with Provenzano and Anthony ""Tony Jack"" Giacalone (Patrick Gallo), is surprised to see Sheeran showing up in Detroit, along with Hoffa's unsuspecting foster son Chuckie O'Brien (Jesse Plemons) and gangster Sal ""Sally Bugs"" Briguglio (Louis Cancelmi). Hoffa is told that the meeting has been arranged in a house where Provenzano and Russell will be waiting for them. Hoffa enters the empty house and realises he has been set up. He turns around to leave at which point Sheeran shoots him twice at point-blank range. After Sheeran departs, two younger gangsters have the body cremated to eliminate all traces of him. There is a grand jury investigation into Hoffa's disappearance, during which Sheeran, Russell, Provenzano and others deny any knowledge. They are all eventually convicted on various charges unrelated to Hoffa's murder, and one by one the elderly criminals die in prison. Sheeran is eventually released and placed in a nursing home. He has alienated himself from his daughters, especially Peggy (Anna Paquin), who suspects his involvement in Hoffa's disappearance. Sheeran tries to reconcile with them, but they sever all contact with him. Whilst in the nursing home Sheeran is given absolution for crimes committed over his lifetime by a Catholic priest. As the priest leaves, Sheeran asks him to leave the door slightly ajar, emulating one of Hoffa's habits. Also starring Harvey Keitel as Angelo Bruno, Stephanie Kurtzuba as Irene Sheeran, Jack Huston as Robert Kennedy / RFK, Kathrine Narducci as Carrie Bufalino and Domenick Lombardozzi as Anthony ""Fat Tony"" Salerno. De Niro gives an interesting as the truck driver turned hitman, Pacino almost steals the show as the charming but equally sinister Hoffa, and Pesci came out of retirement to play a terrific supporting role. This true-life based story is really watchable, with great performances, the splendid playful but classic direction by Scorsese, and the period detail accompanied by gripping moments of violence of criminal activity and violence, and of course the extraordinary special effects to ""de-age"" the actors, it just about uses the three and half hours running time pretty well, a worthwhile epic crime drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Production Design, Best Film Editing, Best Visual Effects, and Best Motion Picture of the Year, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Film, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Production Design, Best Costume Design, and Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay. Very good!",positive
"In the Still of the Night, that great 1950s song, is playing at the beginning and again at the end. Sounds like ""Shodoten Show Be Doe"" but the actual doo-wop lyrics are ""Shoo-doop Shoo-be-doop"", a novelty for this period.The movie, long at almost 3 1/2 hours, follows the life of Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro), an Irishman who became an inside man with the Italian mob figures. I viewed it (at home) as a 2-part miniseries, 2 hours the first day and the rest the second. Nothing in it was boring to me, since I lived through all of it, and I remember the mysterious disappearance of Hoffa in 1975.Al Pacino is Jimmy Hoffa but I remember Hoffa and I could never see Pacino as him. Pacino is a good actor, of course, but he is always Pacino, as he was playing Joe Paterno in a prior movie. I found myself wishing someone else had played Hoffa.There are many name actors but the other main one is Joe Pesci as Russell Bufalino, the quiet mob boss who Sheeren never crossed.In a sense the movie is the life and times, and eventual disappearance, of Hoffa and all the things that transpired during his time, and especially his determination to regain ""HIS"" union and become its president after his prison term, and it eventually led to his demise.This is a very good movie and the main characters are all portrayals of real people. Seems the hit man was the only one to die of natural causes.On DVD from my local public library, my wife skipped, not her kind of movie.",positive
"I won't go through the plot. I will say it was a joy to see Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino. Joe Pesci, Bobby Cannavale and others in ""The Irishman."" There are many reasons to praise Scorsese's work but I think for a film to last nearly 3-1/2 hours and move so quickly is amazing and a tribute to his artistry.The acting is superb. The three stars manage to create characters that are completely fleshed out. In many ways it's a sad story, with DeNiro's character, Sheeran's, last scenes heartbreaking.In actuality, according to a Hoffa expert of 40 years. the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa didn't quite go down as portrayed. Like ""JFK"" the source is one person, and there are conflicting stories. Nevertheless it's compelling.Now I'll go into why I gave this film a 9. I'm sorry and I don't care what anyone else thinks, CGI isn't there yet. Both DeNiro and Pacino looked as if they had scoliosis and no necks, wearing clothes too big for them. I found it very distracting. In one of the first scenes, DeNiro is a young man driving a truck. I didn't recognize him. Too gimmicky. The aging - and I think they made these guys look older than they are - was much better than the deaging.If it didn't take away from anyone's experiences, I'm glad. You can do so much with actual makeup and lighting -- it was at least worth a try.",positive
"Maybe these films weren't my thing. I don't understand the film because it's long and confusing. There are so many people in the film, and I sometimes can't figure out who is who. The ending drags on, and I wish they just stopped at the point when Peggy won't talk to Frank anymore.",negative
"This overlong Marty Scorcese film is a pure Scorcese film, with nothing left on the cutting room floor. Nothing at all. Major studios would have never left this film be made without cutting it and reduce the length to two hours at the most. Scorcese had total freedom in this feature, he told this. THANKS NETFLIX. I could not prevent myself to think about Arthur Penn's LITTLE BIG MAN after viewing this film, which begins in a retirement home, for elders, and with a main character telling his own story and finishing in the same home, leaving the character waiting for death with his memory and souvenirs. It needs to be watched again and again. it's of course a masterpiece, but not for all audiences only in waiting for super héro craps.",positive
"This is a gripping piece of cinema. Messrs. Scorsese, Pesci, De Niro & Pacino deliver a gangster movie like no other. It is a little bit long but that was really only an issue for my circulation in a rather old cinema seat. The 3½ hours flew by. True, we still don't actually know what happened to Jimmy Hoffa but this film offers a compelling and engrossing narrative as to what might have happened, not just to him, but to the whole Mafia-led enterprise that dominated parts of the USA in the sixties and seventies. Whether Charles Brandt's book - upon which this is based - be true, or not is almost academic. This doesn't set out to deliver history, it sets out to deliver a theory, and it does so with style and panache and illustrates with distinction the toxicity of the political situation at the time with all of its concomitant violence, thuggery and nastiness. Excellent!",positive
"In a nursing home Frank ""The Irishman"" Sheeran recounts his days as a teamster and mob hitman. Included in his history is his association with famed Union leader Jimmy Hoffa.Incredible story. Based on the book ""I heard you paint houses"" by Charles Brandt and directed by Martin Scorsese, the movie features the usual Scorsese elements of grittiness and engaging storytelling. Quite an intriguing plot, revolving around one of history's most famous mysteries.Scorsese also surrounds himself with his favourite actors - Robert De Niro (of course), Joe Pesci and Harvey Keitel - and actors with ""mob movie cred"": Al Pacino, Stephen Graham (who played Al Capone in Boardwalk Empire), Bobby Carnavale. It's as if Scorsese was trying to include at least one face from every major mob movie or TV series. I'm sure if James Gandolfini was alive he'd have a part! Steven Van Zandt does have a very minor part, so The Sopranos is still represented!However, in creating this all-star cast the first problem appears: De Niro, Pacino and Pesci are too old for their roles. While some of the scenes are set when the actors are older, much of the movie is set in their middle ages, 30s and 40s. Despite all the best attempts to make them look younger, through makeup and special effects, it is clear that they are not that young, through their movements. It is difficult to imagine Frank Sheeran / Robert De Niro as much of a threat when he looks so fragile.As much as Scorsese wanted to stay loyal to people like De Niro and Pesci, and remind audiences of his previous work with them, a better option would have been to hire younger actors for the roles. It is easier to make a younger actor older than an older actor younger.The other issue is the length of the movie. At 3½ hours the film it was always going to be interesting to see whether the film could remain engaging throughout. It mostly is, but there are scenes that could easily have been edited out. While it never really drifts, Scorsese could easily have conveyed the same amount of plot development with less detail.Overall, a great movie, but not perfect.",positive
"THE IRISHMAN (2019) *** Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Joe Pesci, Harvey Keitel, Ray Romano, Bobby Cannavale, Anna Paquin, Stephen Graham, Stephanie Kurtzuba, Jack Huston, Kathrine Narducci, Jess Plemons, Domenick Lombardozzi, Paul Herman, Gary Basaraba, Marin Ireland, Lucy Gallina, Welker White, Louis Canelmi, Bo Dietl, Sebastian Maniscalo, Aleksa Palladino, Steven Van Zandt, Jim Norton. OldFellas could've been the working title of this Martin Scorsese smorgasbord of wise guys, feds and the assorted sociopaths all under the umbrella of a semi-biography of hit man Frank Sheeran (De Niro, like a lion in winter) who crosses paths with Teamsters Union lead Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino equally regal and on top of his game), with the tightrope act of loyalties with bestie Russell Bufalino (Pesci coaxed out of quasi-retirment and equally prime). Yes Scorsese is still a master craftsman with his cinematic eyes, touchstones of past films and a who's who of Mount Olympus screen actors the film is a scoch bloated in its 3 plus hours running time (um, the fish in the car scene goes on way too long) but is allowed his panache for the art of turning an unlikable character into being flawed and tragic.",positive
"The Irishman is the most ""Goodfellas""-ish movie from Martin Scorsese since 1995's ""Casino."" That's a long time for devotees to wait to see the master director return to the format he virtually invented. Is the wait worth it? Yes and no. ""The Irishman"" is no ""Goodfellas,"" but I'm also not sure it's trying to be, though it's almost impossible not to compare it. For the first half of the film, it's hard not to be dogged by the sense that we've seen all this before but by artists (many of them the same artists) who had more energy for it twenty and thirty years ago. But then late in the movie, we realize that this film has more on its mind than being yet another retread of a mob life epic, and it's the film's last, quiet moments that earn it a place of its own in Scorsese's canon rather than just a Scorsese rip off of Scorsese.""The Irishman"" is very long, but I didn't feel its length that much. And it's the last half hour or so that gives the film it's punch, and only because of everything that's preceded it, so I wouldn't want it to be any shorter. This movie continues past the point where films like ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"" end and suggests that the sometimes hellish life of being a gangster may be nothing compared to the hell of growing old. The main character, played by Robert De Niro, is a mafia ""yes"" man, carrying out orders while trying hard not to think too much about them. As a result, he gives pretty much his entire allegiance to one man (played by Joe Pesci), while alienating everyone else in his life, from his family to close friends (notably Jimmy Hoffa, played by Al Pacino). What happens, then, when the man from whom you've always taken your orders is no longer around to give them? What happens when everyone else who has comprised the very small world in which you have lived has died and left you behind? What happens when you have nothing but time to reflect on the man you have been and the things you have done? What happens when the one thing that made you feel vital no longer exists? It's not hard to believe that Scorsese the filmmaker is using this film to ask himself some of the questions he asks of his characters, and that's what gives ""The Irishman"" a sense of ruminative pathos and makes something richer out of what could have been a glib genre exercise.This is a pretty engrossing, always entertaining, and at times very funny film. But there is one major drawback that I had a heck of a time getting past, and I'm not sure I ever did completely. And that's the fact that everyone in this is simply too old to be playing the characters they're playing. Robert De Niro, vibrant as he may still be, is 76 years old, and, de-aging digital technology aside, he cannot pull off thirty and forty. He and Pesci, similarly de-aged, just look weird and kind of creepy for a good part of the film, and even if the technology can make De Niro look somewhat younger, he still moves like an old man, something most noticeable in a scene where he kicks the crap out of a grocery store owner. At times the movie smacks of a bunch of kind of sad old dudes who are past their prime trying to recapture the glory days of their youths, but then again, given where the movie goes, maybe that's part of the point.One thing, or rather one person, I can heap unqualified praise on is Al Pacino as Jimmy Hoffa. Pacino OWNS this movie. He hasn't been this good in a long, long time.Grade: A",positive
"Scorsese is never going to match that film in my opinion. It was the pinnacle of his career. The soundtrack, pace, edittng, acting were all just marvelous. And it gave you a look into the mob from ""the working mobster's"" point of view that made all similar mob movies look like garbage, before and after.The Irishman is definitely worth your time, telling the story of mobster Frank Sheeran (De Niro) from his point of view, as he talks about how he befriended and ultimately executed James Hoffa. Realize that this is an unproven theory based on Sheeran's deathbed confession. Of course, how are you going to lose when Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci reunite with Scorsese. I'm not sure Pacino has ever worked with Scorsese before, but he's the pro he always was as Jimmy Hoffa.Since Pesci has been retired from acting for twenty years, the thing that struck me was how OLD he looked. It is actually jarring. He plays De Niro's brother in ""Raging Bull"", and a protege a generation younger than him in ""Goodfellas"", but here he is his elder! And then I look it up and Pesci is actually De Niro's age! So, leaving all of that aside, you get the great performances you'd expect, and the intimate viewpoint and story will hold your interest through the long running time. It is just very similar to Goodfellas in technique, and that is not a bad thing except it seemed like I had seen this film before.The one unique thing about it? You get to see these mobsters as they get to very old age and have a chance to reflect and maybe have some regrets. In Goodfellas, the main character is in his late 30s when circumstances force him out of the mob.I'd recommend it if you have ever liked anything that the actors or that Scorsese have done before.",positive
"Greetings again from the darkness. The Copacabana tracking shot in GOODFELLAS in etched not only in my brain, but in cinema lore. Filmmaker Martin Scorsese teases us with a similar shot as the opening sequence in his latest. The camera snakes through the dank halls and rooms of an assisted-living center before settling on the well-worn face of wheelchair-bound octogenarian Frank Sheeran (Robert DeNiro). Mr. Sheeran is the titular Irishman, and he narrates the story of his life, at least as he recalls it. His is a life story that connects the mob to history and politics in a no frills manner surely to provoke thought, skepticism, and a knot in the tummy.Oscar winning writer Steve Zaillian (SCHINDLER'S LIST, also GANGS OF NEW YORK, THE FALCON AND THE SNOWMAN) adapted Charles Brandt's book ""I Heard You Paint Houses"" for the film. Mr. Brandt was Sheeran's attorney and worked with Sheeran on his memoir. The book title is highlighted by Scorsese at both the beginning and end of the film, as well as through a line of dialogue in the first phone conversation between Sheeran and Jimmy Hoffa. Mr. Sheeran was a WWII veteran turned truck driver turned mob hit man (and good soldier). He tells his story with little fanfare and in a way that we understand no glamour is associated with this lifestyle.For those looking for the next GOODFELLAS or CASINO, you'll likely be disappointed. This one is not as flashy or stylish as those two classics, and instead is a 3 and a half hour introspective look at the men who are efficiency experts in power. Violence is merely one of the tools in their box. The presentation is contemplative, not action-centric. The hits are abrupt and jerky and realistic, not the stylistic choreography of shootouts in films like JOHN WICK. There is a skewed theme of friendship and male bonding ... even mentorship. It's unlike what we've seen before from mob movies.After a chance meeting over a timing belt on a delivery truck, Sheeran is taken under the wing of Philadelphia mob boss Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci). This is Pesci's first onscreen appearance since 2010, and he is absolutely brilliant in his portrayal of ""the quiet Don."" His performance is 180 degrees from his comedy in LETHAL WEAPON (2.3.4) or HOME ALONE, and 180 degrees the opposite direction from his roles in GOODFELLAS and CASINO, where he was a bombastic man (not a clown) on the edge of violence at all times. Mr. Pesci has spent the last decade playing jazz under the name Joe Doggs. It's such a joy to have him back on screen, especially as the father figure-friend-ruthless businessman. His Russell is always calm and calculating, whether plotting the next kill or putting up with his wife's frequent smoke breaks on a road trip.It's Russell who directs Sheeran to connect with Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino), President of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Pacino flashes his blustery best as Hoffa in a couple of scenes, but is also terrific while spewing one of his countless ""c***suckers"", or savoring one of his beloved ice cream sundaes - a simple pleasure in a complicated life. Sheeran and Hoffa develop an unusual friendship in their many years together, and Hoffa's real life unsolved disappearance in 1975 is the basis for Sheeran's recollections.We learn that Sheeran's time in WWII taught him to kill ... there is a scene involving POW's digging their own grave while his rifle is pointed at them. In fact, most of the story is told in flashbacks that bounce between different eras. Scorsese, as has been reported ad nauseam, has utilized the de-aging process from Industrial Light & Magic to show DeNiro, Pesci, Pacino and others over the years. The effect is a bit distracting at first, but the story and these characters are so intriguing that we simply roll with after the initial jolt. It's also obvious how Scorsese worked to make DeNiro look like the hulking presence Sheeran was in real life (think Tom Cruise in the Jack Reacher movies). Camera angles, should pads, and shoe lifts are used to make us think DeNiro towers over the others the way Sheeran really did. DeNiro is excellent in portraying Sheeran as a good soldier, reserved in mannerisms - even flashing a slight stutter at times. He's a proud man who simply looks at the mob work as his job.In addition to the three stars who each excel in their roles, Scorsese has assembled a huge and talented cast. Harvey Keitel is chilling in a couple of scenes as Angelo Bruno, Ray Romano plays mob lawyer Bill Bufalino, Bobby Cannavale is steak-loving Skinny Razor, Jesse Plemons is Hoffa's adopted son Chuckie O'Brien, Domenick Lombardozzi is Fat Tony Salerno, comedian Sebastian Maniscalco is ""Crazy Joe"" Gallo, Louis Cancelmi is bespectacled Sally Bugs, Jack Huston plays Attorney General Bobby Kennedy, and even Steven Van Zandt plays crooner Jerry Vale.You are probably wondering, 'Where are the women?'. While there is no Lorraine Bracco (GOODFELLAS) or Sharon Stone (CASINO), Scorsese makes the point that with Sheeran, and these other mobsters, it's all business and real family relationships are non-existent. Stephanie Kurtzuba plays Irene Sheeran (Frank's second wife) and Katherine Narducci is Carrie Bufalino (Russell's cig-loving wife). They have some brief but entertaining moments on the road trip, and Marin Ireland has an effective scene late in the movie as Carrie, one of Frank's daughters, while Welker White plays Jo Hoffa. But it's Sheeran's daughter Peggy who is the quiet moral center of the story and his life. Played as a youngster by Lucy Gallina and later by Anna Paquin, Peggy is a mostly silent observer of her father, and whatever conscience he has, is impacted by her glances. Ms. Paquin is especially good with one question ... ""Why?""Worthy of special mention is Stephen Graham who plays Anthony ""Tony Pro"" Provenzano, a friend-turned-rival of Hoffa. Graham and Pacino share two standout scenes - one in prison, while Hoffa scoops his sundae, and a later meeting where Hoffa takes offense to Tony Pro's late arrival and attire. Both scenes are remarkable in that there is underlying humor balancing the surface anger. In fact, the film is filled with memorable scenes. Hoffa's guidance on self-defense in guns vs. knives, and most every scene between DeNiro's Sheeran and Pesci's Russell. DeNiro and Pesci have a chemistry few actors share. It dates back to RAGING BULL (1980), and I believe this is their 7th film together.The film reminds me of the 1970's movies that fueled my movie obsession: THE GODFATHER I and II, THE CONVERSATION, THE FRENCH CONNECTION, CHINATOWN, and even THE LAST PICTURE SHOW. Sheeran may or may not be a reliable narrator, but these are real people - even if we don't know the specifics on every hit. Captions are periodically included to inform of us how a particular mobster met his maker - again providing some dark humor. What is a bit surprising is the male bonding, even friendship, between guys in such a brutal profession. And watching how the story weaves in and out of history with the Bay of Pigs, Cuba casinos, and the Kennedy assassination -""If they can whack a President ..."" is a bit unsettling.Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (SILENCE, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN) is a good fit for Scorsese's vision, and you can catch the varying camera styles for each character - and don't miss the stunning shot of the illicit guns in the river. Composer Robbie Robertson (The Band) delivers Scorsese trademark musical riffs, and 3-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmacker is in peak form editing this epic. This is the 8th film collaboration for Scorsese and DeNiro, but the first in 25 years (CASINO).I'm a little concerned. In fact, I'm a little more than concerned. This feels like the end of an era. It's not the end of Scorsese films, but it's the final chapter of his mob films. No other filmmaker comes close in this genre. With the bookends of Sheeran reminiscing in the assisted-living home, this is quite the holiday gift for cinephiles ... and a last one (providing Netflix survives).",positive
"The Irishman is Goodfellas all over again, without as much snap and an hour longer.De Niro's too old to play this role, for the first part anyway, him attacking the grocer's laughable. The acting's solid, though I don't see much difference between Pacino here and his other characters. I was expecting Pesci to have an outburst when his wife lit up her cigarette in one of the opening scenes. It's obviously done to have that affect, showing he's a more refined character. Not memorable like in Goodfellas, but still decent. Hoffa being whacked the best part, also with Frank and Russell getting to that point, but the first half drags a fair bit.",negative
"THE NEXT LEVEL is a disappointingly ho-hum follow up to the enjoyable JUMANJI reboot, a film which got by mainly on a funny script and plenty of charisma from the likes of The Rock.

Instead, we get a bunch of that most lazy of Hollywood innotations, the giant CGI action spectacle set-piece, which just go on and on and feel like watching somebody else playing a computer game.

Bethany could have join the group from the beginning which would simplify the story and possibly shorten it a little. The Rock and Kevin Hart are both having fun but Awkwafina is probably the best old man. This movie is missing the fade from the real life characters and their avatars. That's especially needed in the magic waters. All in all, this is fun but it could be better if simplifications are done to shorten the movie.",positive
"I am very fond of the first iteration of JUMANJI, with Robin Williams giving a wonderful performance and the latest in CGI, which looks either quaintly charming or charmingly quaint a quarter of a century later. The remake a couple of years ago struck me as foolish before I saw it, but it turned into a highly amusing movie, with some favored performers. It made enough money that now it is a series. If they continue at this level, it will be a pleasant movie for me to see every couple of years.When we last saw Jumanji, it had been turned into a home video game, and the youngsters were vowing never to return. Well, by and large they do, because the last one turned into a surprise hit. They're a couple of years older, cracks have formed in their relationships, and for various reasons, two of them can't go in, because their avatars are taken by Danny Devito as Alex Wolff's grandfather, and Danny Glover as Devito's former business partner. They've been angry with each other for several years.It's a different adventure, and it makes as much sense as any video game. The avatars get swapped around, so the acting fun consists of watching the actors playing other actors in a FACE OFF sort of way. Dwayne Johnson does a pretty good Devito imitation, but Awkwafina does a better one.This is one movie that is not going to win any awards, but if you're not in the mood for deep-dish suffering nor for something biliously Christmas-like, this is a movie with good performers in roles and situations that will amuse you.",positive
"After the financial success of Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle. Director Jake Kasdan assembles the cast for a sequel and gets a for new senior members.It begins with unhappy Spencer (Alex Wolff) coming home for the festive holidays and restarting the console game of Jumanji.His friends Bethany (Madison Iseman), Fridge (Ser'Darius Blain) and Martha (Morgan Turner) find out that Spencer has gone into the game and follow him. They get stuck into a new adventure where they need to get a magical necklace from the big bad brutal baddie.It soon comes to light that two new players have been sucked in the game. Spencer's grandfather Eddie (Danny Devito) and his bickering old business partner Milo (Danny Glover). Eddie has no idea what is going on but discovers that he has the body in the shape of Dwayne Johnson's Dr Bravestone.Milo is Franklin 'Mouse' Finbar (Kevin Hart) is a zoologist who talks very slowly and rambles on leaving everyone in danger. Martha has the avatar of the athletic Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan).Jake Kasdan's father Lawrence wrote for both Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. There are elements here that are straight out of Spielberg's playbook. The rampaging ostriches in the desert could easily be Velociraptors in Jurassic Park.There is not much originality in this film. It is very much a retread of the last movie. The characters bicker, Eddie and Milo argue even more regarding their former diner closing down as Milo wanted to retire.The characters encounter dangers such as rampaging monkeys, they sometimes die in hilarious situations and lose a life. The main difference being that avatars can be swapped and this time the avatars also have weaknesses.The movie was too long with too many dull moments and the feeling you have seen it all before. The antagonists were wasted as they only played a minor part in the film.",negative
"Poor Spencer (Alex Wolff) has issues with his feelings and repairs the game enough to enter. His friends become concerned and go after him. Danny Devito and Danny Glover get sucked in also. Solve the game, save Jumanji and exit. The twist is they have changed characters (save one) and have weaknesses that they have in real life.Not as good as the first reboot, but entertaining in spite of the tritely written drama. Dwayne Johnson was great as being occupied by Danny Devito and Hart was decent as Glover.",positive
"The fact we get some old school people here ... well the whole different bodies thing remains the same, but we get some new interesting characters here. Which is a nice change. No pun intended. Overall I reckon it remains the same formula and why change it when it worked the first time around.Lives given, lives taken and all that jazz. The special effects are terrific and the way the movie works its magic (no pun intended) is impressive. This may be enough for you or not. I kind of think, this works a bit better than the first one, what with the addition of new characters. But that will be up to you to decide.",positive
"I'm probably one of the few people that went about this all wrong. I haven't seen any of the prior movies, including the Robin Williams original film from 1995. Can anyone believe it's been twenty five years? So with all that, I thought this was fairly entertaining. It was a hoot to see actors like Duane Johnson, Kevin Hart, and Jack Black assume different personas as they made their way through the challenges thrown at them on the way to acquiring the Falcon Jewel. They all did a pretty good job of impersonating the characters they turned into, and even though the two Danny's, DeVito and Glover, didn't have a lot of screen time, you could feel their presence throughout the picture because of their roles portrayed by the avatars. As a senior citizen though, my best take away from the story came at the very end when DeVito's character came to terms with his age and stated to his grandson, ""Getting old is a gift"". I never really thought of it that way, and you know, it makes a lot of sense. For me, that was worth watching the movie all by itself.",positive
"The original movie is a childhood favourite of mine, and the reboot movie (almost a sequel as well), Welcome to the Jungle, was actually good fun, and was one of the highest-grossing films of the year, so naturally the makers followed with a direct sequel, directed by Jake Kasdan (Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story, Bad Teacher). Basically, three years after entering the video game Jumanji, Spencer Gilpin (Alex Wolff), Anthony ""Fridge"" Johnson (Ser'Darius Blain), Martha Kaply (Morgan Turner), and Bethany Walker (Madison Iseman) lead different lives, but plan to reunite in Brantford. Spencer has become depressed, since he and Martha are having complications in their relationship, and he feels he has no purpose. Spencer contemplates returning to Jumanji and spends his first night looking over the broken video-game system he held onto. The following day, his friends visit his home, meeting with Spencer's grandfather Eddie (Danny DeVito), who is recovering from hip surgery, and Eddie's former friend Milo Walker (Danny Glover), who is visiting for an unknown reason. The group search the house for Spencer and find the Jumanji game repaired in the basement. Realising Spencer returned to the game, his friends decide to follow him. The game malfunctions when starting up, sucking in only Fridge and Martha, along with Eddie and Milo. Inside the game, Martha finds herself as her avatar Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan), but Fridge has become Bethany's avatar Professor Professor Sheldon 'Shelly' Oberon (Jack Black), while Eddie is Dr. Smolder Bravestone (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, also producing) and Milo is Franklin 'Mouse' Finbar (Kevin Hart). After instructing Eddie and Milo on the game's rules, the group encounter non-player character Nigel Billingsley (Rhys Darby), the game's guide, who reveals that Jumanji is suffering from a massive drought. To leave the game, the group must recover the ""Falcon's Heart"" - a magical necklace stolen by warlord Jurgen the Brutal (Rory McCann) - which can end the drought if brought before sunlight and uttering ""Jumanji"". The group are transported to a desert called the Dunes, and narrowly escape a flock of pursuing ostriches. Bethany meanwhile finds fellow Jumanji player Alex Vreeke (Colin Hanks) for help to enter the game and help her friends. Inside the game, the group find Spencer, who has become a new avatar, skilled thief Ming Fleetfoot (Awkwafina), who agrees to help them after blaming himself for their predicament. The group face new challenges and problems whilst escaping the Dunes and collect a needed in-game item called a Jumanji Berry. Whilst obtaining the fruit, Fridge and Martha discover a pool of green glowing water that allows them to exchange their avatars. On the journey, Eddie and Milo bicker, it is revealed their friendship ended when Milo sold a diner they owned behind Eddie's back, forcing him into retirement. The group next encounter a perilous series of broken hanging bridges, whilst being pursued by an aggressive troop of mandrills. They soon become reunited with Alex, as his avatar Jefferson 'Seaplane' McDonough (Nick Jonas), and Bethany, operating a new avatar called Cyclone - a black horse that can only be understood by Finbar. After leaving the Dunes, the party find a river with the same glowing green water, allowing Spencer, Bethany, and Fridge to become their original avatars, while Eddie and Milo end up as Ming and Cyclone respectively. Shortly after changing characters, Jurgen and his mercenaries capture the group and brings them to his fortress. Escaping captivity, Spencer and chases after Jurgen to his airship, while the others distract his men. Jurgen is too strong for Spencer, but then he realises he has a weakness, the Jumanji Berry, which incapacitates him and sends him plummeting to his death. Discovering Cyclone has retractable wings, Eddie and Milo work together to rescue Spencer and bring the recovered Falcon's Heart to the sun, calling out ""Jumanji"", ending the drought and completing the game. The necklace is given to Nigel for safekeeping, but the group are surprised when Milo wants to stay behind. Eddie learned that Milo was dying of cancer, hence why he wanted to make amends, they reconcile before Milo flies away. Upon returning to the real world, Spencer and his grandfather play video games together, while Eddie returns to his old diner and longs to work as a manager, with his grandson and his friends turning up to enjoy a meal together. But the game may not be over, as a Heater Repair Man (Lamorne Morris) is drawn to the video game system, and a flock of ostriches suddenly rush past the diner. Also starring John Ross Bowie as Cavendish, Massi Furlan as Switchblade, Marin Hinkle as Spencer's Mom, Bebe Neuwirth as Nora Shepherd and Dania Ramirez as Flame. As before, Johnson and Gillan kick butt, and Black and Hart provide the laughs, DeVito and Glover give the film some heart, and Awkwafina is a good new addition. It feels like almost exactly the same story as before though, there are not quite enough dangerous jungle creatures like the original, and it again relies more on the jokes, at least there are some reasonably exciting sequences with good special effects, not a bad action adventure comedy. Worth watching!",positive
"The first Jumanji film, Welcome To The Jungle, was a lot of fun thanks to an amusing script, lots of entertaining state-of-the-art CG adventure action, and a great cast that included Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black and Kevin Hart. However, in my opinion, the best thing about the film was lovely Karen Gillan as Jumanji game avatar Ruby Roundhouse, a babelicious, kick-ass red-head in a skimpy outfit.The 'abs'-olutely gorgeous Gillan is back for the sequel and hotter than ever, making this a no-brainer for me, but the film itself is an otherwise fairly forgettable retread of the last one, with the same group of friends returning to the game where they attempt to save Jumanji (again) by retrieving another stone (from a barbarian and his horde). This time the gang is joined by two new players, Spencer's grandfather Eddie (Danny DeVito) and fellow OAP Milo (Danny Glover), which leads to not-very-funny gags (repeated ad nauseum) about the elderly characters struggling to understand their situation.The script could have been written by a ten-year-old, such is the level of invention and the sophistication of the humour. The action is, once again, visually impressive (especially in 3D) but heavily reliant on CGI, lacking a sense of realism with little in the way of genuine excitement or thrills to be had. At no point do we feel that the characters are in any real peril, especially given that each of them have three lives to waste, which we all know will be more than enough for them to complete the task at hand.Given how much I enjoyed the first film, I'm surprised at just how average The Next Level is. Another Jumanji adventure is undoubtedly on the cards, and as long as Gillan is there, so will I, but I seriously hope the makers pay more attention to the plot and the comedy next time around.",negative
"This movie is crazy! But it a fun entertaining way. We watched it two years after we watched the first one with this basic cast of characters. The main four get sucked in again and become characters quite different from their own selves back home. One of them keeps reminding the others, we are in a game, those are not real. Each has three lives to give, signified by the three black bars on the inside of their arm. When one meets an untimely death, a few seconds later they drop from the sky back to the others, in a fall that would kill a real person. But they are just characters in the game. So they brush themselves off and continue.It was fun for me to see the inclusion of two veteran actors that I have watched many times in many different roles over the years, Danny DeVito and Danny Glover. They play old friends who had become estranged after they quit jointly running a local restaurant, and now must cope with this new existence in the game.Overall forgettable but a crazy entertaining two hours if you are in the right mood. My wife and I watched it on BluRay from our public library, after dinner and wine. The wine probably helped!Crazy!",positive
"If you enjoy the ""Jumanji"" movie franchise, then you will definitely also enjoy this 2019 addition. You know what you are getting yourself into when you sit down to watch the movie, and writers Jake Kasdan, Jeff Pinkner and Scott Rosenberg definitely deliver as expected.There is an abundance of fast-paced action, funny characters, witty banter and dialogue, as well as a very wholeheartedly entertainment value to the movie. It is actually quite nice to have the characters return to the screen and having the actors and actresses there as well.Visually then ""Jumanji: The Next Level"" definitely is up to par with the previous movie, if not slightly better actually. Everything delivered by the CGI team looks splendid and very realistic. Which is a must for an adventure movie such as this.The movie is nicely carried by the likes of Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, Kevin Hart, Karen Gillan, Nick Jonas, Awkwafina, Danny DeVito and Danny Glover. There are also some nice appearances by the likes of Colin Hanks and Bebe Neuwirth.I can warmly recommend that you sit down to watch ""Jumanji: The Next Level"" regardless of doing so alone or with the family. This is an enjoyable and entertaining movie, with something for everyone to like and behold.I am rating ""Jumanji: The Next Level"" a six out of ten stars.",positive
"This is a fun and funny adventure! The suspension bridge scene really got my palms sweating. There is a big emphasis on friendship and bonding, and I really like this theme. It is a great escapist adventure, both for the characters and the viewers!",positive
"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle was an unexpected triumph, especially when you consider it was up against Star Wars at the box office. What was more impressive though was the way that it managed to be both original and yet doff its cap to the 1995 original film starring Robin Williams. Trying to repeat the trick with another sequel though would be a risk.Thankfully though this does what all good sequels do and give us lots of what we liked about the last film, with a little more on top.Full of good jokes and some excellent performances, this was a good old fashioned action comedy.I would've liked a few more nods to the Robin Williams original, buy on the whole this was enjoyable.",positive
"Just imagine what you'd get if you shoved Indiana Jones, Where Eagles Dare, The Mummy and Taxi into the smoothie-maker; then added the music from Lawrence of Arabia, Tarzan and, oh yes - the Mummy again. I'll tell you - you would get this. The film doesn't have an original idea in it's two hour duration. HOWEVER - that doesn't make it bad. The same cast all pull together well and the action is pretty much end-to-end. The special effects are good, and it has killer ostriches. Danny DeVito looks worryingly like a racoon at times, but owns each scene he is in; Awkwafina is quite adept as the new, nimble-fingered member of the team and Nick Jonas stands about looking pretty. This is definitely not brain food, but there is plenty of humour for most of us and it doesn't drag. Ideal for this (Christmas) time of year. An added bonus for me, was that it drew a bigger audience tonight than probably the last ten films I have seen at our local Odeon put together.",positive
"The gang from Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle are back and now face new challenges.I enjoyed Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle. The concept was fairly original: four real-life people get transported into a video game, are transformed into in-game characters quite different from their real-life ones all with unique traits, skills, strengths and weaknesses and have to battle to survive and get back to reality. Good fun.'The Next Level' is more of the same. Also fairly good fun but now the novelty has worn off. It initially just seemed like a rehash of the previous film, so much so I thought I was accidentally watching the first one again!The plot does develop some freshness as it develops but it all seems rather formulaic.Ultimately, okayish but that's all.",negative
"I loved every aspect of this movie, it was funny, it was action packed adventure, and had an awesome homage to the original. I liked that they took a lot of elements from the previous jumanji, that really translated well. Devito and Glover added so much to this cast, seeing the rock and Kevin hart as their avatars was so fun. The plot, the characters, the humor, it really ticked all the boxes. The only downside was the length, could have lost some minor scenes.",positive
"Our four young friends from Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle are changed by their experience, though Spencer remains beset with self-doubt and has drawn away from everyone, even Martha. So he chooses to escape back into the game (repaired, but faulty) in the hope of another jolt of Braveheart. Unfortunately, when the other 3 try to follow him, things go wrong. And by things, I mean Spencer's crotchety grandfather Eddie, recovering from a hip operation, and Eddie's ex-partner and ex-friend Milo.It is a nice wrinkle to have the avatars occupied by different players, two of whom barely grasp the concept of videogames The videogame conceits are still there - we are now at the next level of the game, the avatars have taken on new abilities and weaknesses, and new playable characters are introduced. But otherwise we are in for another ride full of excitement and humour, with the avatar cast given the opportunity to have great fun playing familiar characters how playing host to entirely different people. It's a clever development of the idea underlying its predecessor.And, as always, Jumanji rewards those who play it successfully, sometimes in very surprising ways. And the closing moments of the movie carry a lovely tribute to the original movie.",positive
"The two main questions going into this movie were 1.) How would the four characters we loved in Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle be drawn back into the game and 2.) would it be as good?As for question number one, it was a bit absurd, but Spencer (Alex Wolff) was so depressed and emotionally lost that he pined to be Dr. Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson) again. So, he repaired the busted game console in order to reenter it. The other characters, being his faithful friends, went in after him.As for question number two, it was just about as good. I liked the idea of introducing new people to be characters in the game. Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart's characters were in fact two elderly men (Danny DeVito and Danny Glover). That small tweak made the movie fresh and funny. Kevin Hart and Jack Black stole the show, the two of them were hilarious.",positive
"Going in knowing little about the title,I was surprised in late 2017 how much of a thrill ride Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (2017-also reviewed) turned out to be. Chatting to a pal about meeting up before X-Mas, he suggested us going to see the new Jumanji, which led to me getting set to play a new game.View on the film:Showing they've still got game,Danny DeVito and Danny Glover as old pals Eddie and Milo, who find a new lust for life from the new reality the game offers. Wisely keeping all the players from the last film together,the ensemble cast unlock all the achievements with awesome turns, as fittie Karen Gillan performs Roundhouse's new spinning kicks (which spoofs Lara Croft's old moves) with a real crunch, Jack Black dead pans his frustrations over his avatar having no fighting skills, The Rock and Kevin Hart continue their tag team of Hart's agitated quips with Rock's crowd pleasing one-liners and slick fighting moves.Coding the new levels, returning co-writer/(with Jeff Pinkner and Scott Rosenberg) director Jake Kasdan & cinematographer Gyula Pados open the new game modes up to a thrilling breakneck Action Adventure atmosphere, taking detours from the jungle setting to winter castles caught in sky-high wide-shots by Kasdan. Along with expanding the game setting, Kasdan also merrily riffs on staples of video games, from stuck on repeat NPC's and deadly traps puzzle games, to the gang falling from the sky after losing a life level, as they try to beat the next level.",positive
"Jumanji: The Next Level has no heart and no consequence, it's fluff.The casting of Johnson and Hart lets you know the lack of sincerity with which the project is regarded in the first place. The original's a masterpiece, this possesses none of the charm. In fact, they're nothing alike. I didn't realize there was already a sequel before this, but I feel no need to see it as it has most of the same cast. Has a bit of humour with Black and DeVito, who don't even appear to be in the previous film, but it's all a joke and not that funny.",negative
Takes a while to remember what happened in number 1 and sort out the characters. There are some exciting scenes in the desert and the bridges. Not that funny when they try for laughs. The nature is pretty. Although they do try hard to talk the way their characters do. The Rock is pretty good comically Awakfina is a welcome addition.,negative
"There are not a lot of franchises that are good from the beginning till the end but Jumanji is an exception to that rule. The quality of the movies is constant so if you liked the first or the second movie you will probably like this one as well. I always have a lot of pleasure watching any of the Jumanji movies. There is that right amount of humor mixed with adventure. The CGI's are well done, giving the movie an extra little thing that adds to the adventurous feeling when your watching Jumanji. The cast is like usual very good in Jumanji. Every character and actor adds something special to the plot. I'm normally not a fan at all of The Rock but in Jumanji Dwayne Johnson is actually funny to watch. And even if the story is basically the same in all Jumanji movies it's still entertaining, that says enough about the quality of these movies. I'm not done with Jumanji, I could watch another one.",positive
"Jumanji: The Next Level deserves praise for for not only reminding use why the first one was good, but also for its adept handling of sequel chores. It's back to the jungle but with more characters, good story and loads of charm. The slight bank towards zany is welcome here and makes for an easygoing and entertaining diversion after the holidays. To me, Jack Black is the standout for shouldering much of the humor, and I'm pleased to see a franchise being built on solid and heartfelt foundations.",positive
"Recently, our deep in trouble mall brought back it's first video arcade in many years. Well, this movie upgraded it's cast from the first one, and it doesn't lose a thing versus the earlier film. I'm not sure if an arcade now will be in time to save our mall (though it would help if they brought movie theaters back into too), but this movie is entertaining and a whole lot of funny.Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, Kevin Heart, and additions like veteran Danny Devito are all positive in this one. The plot is exactly the same as the first time around, another video game of Jumanji only with real people thrown into the game. If anything, the script is a solid item indeed and the cast brings it off.The film never gives a viewer much chance tro rest. There's action on top of action, just like the video game. If they make enough of these, there will come a day when a marathon of them will be playing, and playing and playing and maybe, just maybe the next game will rescue our ailing mall. A lot of malls are being turned into Senior Housing. Rushing in a good game of Jumanji could improve sales- at the Tom Brady Scooter store.Put your brain away and enjoy this action film.",positive
"There seems to be a craze for assassin movies at the moment and Netflix's POLAR is the latest instalment in this overworked sub-genre. It's a comic book adaptation that's as gratuitously explicit, offensive and violent as it gets, so an obvious inspiration here is the kind of craziness we saw in DEADPOOL. The film even cocks a snook or two at JOHN WICK over the course of its running time. The plot is a familiar one, but this is undoubtedly a case of style over substance with lots of colourful cinematography and outrageous moments. It's one of the most violent films I've seen in a while, with extremely bloody shoot-outs and assassinations throughout; it's also light-hearted despite the explicit murder and torture taking place. Mads Mikkelsen is superb as the cliched-but-cool taciturn assassin, and the underrated Katheryn Winnick (VIKINGS) is pretty cool as his antagonist. Unfortunately some of the supporting actors go so over the top as to be completely annoying (I'm talking about you, Matt Lucas) although they'd argue that's all in the comic book spirit. In the end, there's nothing here you haven't seen before, but the cinematography and style is fresh enough to give it enough energy to be worth a watch.",negative
"Duncan Vizla (Mads Mikkelsen) is close to retirement as a working class assassin. He befriends troubled neighbor Camille (Vanessa Hudgens) in their remote community. He is due to receive millions in payout by his employer Mr. Blut (Matt Lucas). What he doesn't know is that Blut has been sending out his assassination team to murder all of his retiring killers to avoid the pension payouts. Blut's right hand man Vivian (Katheryn Winnick) lures Vizla to an ambush in Belarus.This is trying very hard to be an outrageous comic book movie. I don't mind it although Matt Lucas is more silly than threatening. It's not that he's funny either. The best part is the confrontation between Vizla and the kill team. It's the thrilling climax of the movie. The later action is not quite as compelling. I don't care about Blut and Vivian only slightly more. I only really love the team of killers. Once they're dead, the movie loses some of its punch. It's one movie where I wouldn't mind if it ends sooner. Vizla could vow revenge against Blut for the sequel who could send another team of killers. As it stands, the movie slowly fades with a few cool moves like Vizla waving his lazer fingers. The movie needs a better Blut if it wants me to be invested in his death.",negative
"The efficient hitman Duncan Vizla (Mads Mikkelsen) will retire in a couple of days and will receive an eight-million dollars pension from the organization where he works as retirement plan.

Duncan moves to an isolated cabin in Montana and befriends his only neighbor Camille (Vanessa Hudgens), a shy young woman. Meanwhile Vivian hires Duncan for one last job to kill the assassins of the retired hitman Michael Green, but with the intention of killing Duncan. However he kills the gang and returns to his house. Blut decides to send a team of assassins to kill Duncan at home. Will they succeed?""Polar"" is an action thriller with a violent and brutal story of double-cross and revenge.

Blut (Matt Lucas) who owns the company has been clearing the debt by retiring retired agents, and those about to retire. Duncan also known as ""The Black Kaiser"" is targeted, but won't go easy.The film was in part, grindhouse. There was a twist to the tale that really didn't add anything. A shoot them up action film. Not much thinking.Guide: F-word, sex, nudity ( Anastasia Marinina + others) WARNING: Richard Dreyfuss does karaoke.",negative
"Highly stylized and ultra-violent, this will mostly appeal to fans of the 'Deadpool' style of over the top action and unrestricted mayhem. Not to be unexpected, as this this is also based on a comic book creation from Dark Horse Entertainment. I liked the original premise of the story until I began thinking about it a little bit, because there's a fundamental flaw in Blut's (Matt Lucas) business model. You see, if his plan is to exterminate retiring employees in order to avoid paying their termination pension, then why would any of his other assassins on the payroll hang around for the same eventual treatment? Kind of a self defeating business plan, don't you think?And anyway, what self respecting assassin joins an organization like Damocles to look for work anyway? If you're as talented as Léon,The Professional, the work automatically finds you wherever you are. Be that as it may, Mads Mikkelsen turns in an exemplary performance as Duncan Vizla, assassin extraordinaire who figures out his plight and decides to turn the tables on his employer and army of hired killers. I won't go into how impossible the entire scenario becomes regarding Blut's torture and Duncan's 'good as new' offensive strategy on the fourth day, because that's not what a movie like this is all about. If you're here, it's because of the wild action and mindless bloodletting. Personally, I got more of a kick out of Duncan's 'show and tell' with the grade school class, fascinated by the customs associated with dead people.The sub plot with Camille (Vanessa Hudgens) seemed a little off to me as well. It's never made clear how and why she came to live almost right next door to Duncan in Triple Oak, Montana. The intermediary who sent her the two hundred thousand dollar annual payments presumably kept Duncan's identity a secret, so how would her search for the man who killed her family in a case of mistaken identity bring her to such a remote town? In the grand scheme of things it's a rhetorical question, but it's stuff like that I think about.Well, have fun with this one. You'll be immediately impressed with the gorgeous cinematography and exceptionally colorful palette applied to virtually every filming location. It's almost too bright for an assassin flick, though most of the relentless action and violent kills occur at night and in the darkened tunnels of the Blut mansion. Be aware though of those flashback scenes of Duncan's prior hit jobs, they have the potential of being vertigo inducing.",positive
"Very much a vehicle for Mads Mikkelsen (who also exec. produced it) as an old hit man who finds himself in danger as his old boss decides to bump him off so as to ... wait for it... claim his pension! Look not for depth of character nor a thought-provoking script; this has the look and feel of a violent video game transferred to the screen. The supporting cast really don't deliver much - two really bad performances from Matt Lucas and Katheryn Winnick and one mediocre one from the good looking, but dreadfully insipid Vanessa Hudgens leave the star well and truly out on his own.... There is plenty of action, and it isn't dull, but it's pretty shallow stuff that leaves little to remember it by afterwards.",negative
"A movie of excessive violence that looks as if it stays true to its source material as there's a definite comic book look and feel to it. Those familiar with the retired assassin who finds himself the target of his former employer appear to be disappointed, but others might be entertained by the nihilistic tone and breathless pace. Matt Lucas was clearly born to play spoilt mastermind villains and giant babies.",negative
"When I sat down to watch this movie after Netflix recommended to me, I admit that I didn't know what kind of tone I was going to get, though I assumed it would be a constant tone. However, the first half of the movie was so uneven that I almost stopped watching. The first half can't seem to decide what kind of movie it is supposed to be. Sometimes it's a standard serious action movie, but sometimes it's a really dark and black goofy exercise. The two extremes don't really mix too well, and the result is that in this first half, the tone of the movie feels just wrong. The violence feels too harsh next to the humor, and the humor feels kind of depraved next to the violence. The second half of the movie is much better, because it mostly plays out in one basic tone, a revenge actioner. This half of the movie is pretty well done, and had the whole movie been like that, we would probably have had a clear winner. But as it is, you have to sit through a really uneven first 50 or so minutes before the movie finds its groove. I was never bored at any moment, I admit, so that's why I'm giving the movie a marginal thumbs-up. If you are prepared to forgive the movie for its uneven first half, it's probably worth a look.",positive
"If you are into hard action flicks then this is your thing but you have to take the absurdness with it. If you like the Punisher series then watch it without hesitation.Face it, what the main character has to stand through normally you are death but hey, if you can stand things that can't be seen in real life then you will like this. It's absurd and brutal. And the story isn't that bad after all. Perfect casting, clichés all over, really, another Netflix surprise for me.Be advised, it has a lot of blood and gratuitous nudity. Gore 1/5 Nudity 1/5 Effects 2,5/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",negative
"There are good and bad things in Polar but overall the positive things outwheighs the negative things. The action is way over the top with a hero (played brilliantly by Mads Mikkelsen) facing twenty or more ennemies at the same time and still winning, it's sometimes a bit annoying but that's what you get with these kind of movies so it's best to not pay too much attention to that kind of details. Matt Lucas (from Little Brittain) should stick with things he's best at, short humoristic sketches, as to me he's the weakest link in Polar. His evil character has no credibility at all when played by him. Mads Mikkelsen is by far the best actor in this movie. His character was perfect for him, introvert and stone cold, the face fits the character. The action scenes, even though exaggerated, are entertaining and bloody, the cinematography is surprisingly good with very good unique shots at times. All in all Polar is an entertaining movie especially in this genre.",positive
"Imagine John Wick part 26 and you get this. It's lame, boring, doesn't add up and seems to serve no purpose than to serve gore and violence. And truthfully, that's boring, too. Hard R? I've seen French kids movies that are more brutal. And the cast... what were they doing there? Mads Mikkelsen? The annoying robot from Doctor Who? Lagertha? The Master from The Strain (no makeup, though), Richard freaking Dreyfuss looking so old you believe him when he says he is dying? It felt like one of those Russian movies that buy a few American actors to front something done with lots of money and no talent or passion and expected only to make e profit. No soul, just a eurogangster Hollywood clone.Let me be unambiguous: this is not one of those ""OK, they tried and it didn't work"" movies. It's something that no one expected to work except as a trap for gullible viewers who believe bought magazine ad reviews. It's so bad that getting drunk will not make it funny. It's so bad that the few good scenes feel so out of place you suspect it's some kind of parody with a deeper sense that you can't grasp yet. It's so bad you can't believe you are watching it and you just have to watch it to the end to make sure it isn't all a setup for an after credit scene that points to the real movie. It's so bad you will consider scanning your brain for computer viruses after watching it.Don't watch it. Shame, Mads! I had higher expectations from you.",negative
"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningDuncan Vizla (Mads Mikkelsen) was one of the top assassins in the business, but has now become reclusive, and lives a quiet life in isolation. However, recently there have been a spate of killings of other former top guns for hire, and it seems he may be next. It all links to his former employers, headed by the flamboyant Blut (Matt Lucas), who have a policy of removing former killers once they turn fifty. Meanwhile, he befriends Camille (Vanessa Hudgens), a young woman who may hold more keys to his past than he imagines.Once we've strapped ourselves in for the long and bumpy ride that is Polar, we open with a pleasant poolside location, with bright sunny weather and hot girls and cocaine on tap, Earth, Wind and Fire's September playing in the background, only for it all to be shattered by a group of paid killers turning up (along with one of the girls) and a brutal killing sets a totally different tone. But it's just one of many leaps and jumps in Jonas Akerlund's hard hitting but uneven action thriller.It jumps on the modern trend of fusing cool, stylish, flashy visuals and credits with blood splattered, brutal violence, which is pretty unflinching and full on throughout. It certainly reminds you of Tarantino, and indeed the plot itself is more-or-less directly lifted from his Kill Bill Volume 1 and 2 films. But what it can't shy away from is the conflicting tones of this and the more heartfelt, gentle moments in the film, where Vizla bears his soul and connects with Camille, which makes it feel like two different films.Cast wise, Mikkelsen certainly has effective presence as the dark, moody, gruffly spoken hitman, although this is at odds with the film's more humourous elements, and Hudgens is good as the gently embittered Camille, whilst Little Britain's Lucas makes a surprising appearance as the chief villain, although his camp English persona and equally genteel secretary feel like they belong in a film with more of a fantasy element to it.But while the violence and style catch your eye, at just under two hours, it's an overlong film, telling a cliched story that doesn't have enough gravitas to last the length, while also struggling with an uneven tone that knocks your senses about more than all the shooting and bloodletting on display. ***",positive
"Even since Liam Neeson put down his pipe and slippers and started wiping out scores of henchmen at least a third of his age (ala 'Taken') there's been a bit of a trend in Hollywood action films to cast an older hero in the lead. I've seen films where Sean Penn and Nicholas Cage basically follow in Neeson's footsteps and now it looks like it's the turn of Mads Mikkelsen to pick a gun or twenty and go on a murderous rampage of revenge.The story isn't anything new. He's a hitman who gets doublecrossed by is own side and now a team of hitmen is hunting our hitman. Apparently, it's based on a Dark Horse comic and I haven't read that, so I can't say how closely it sticks to the source material, but it certainly does its best to make itself LOOK like a comic book. Seriously, I don't know exactly how they've done it, but it must have something to do with exposing certain colours and using filter-trickery. Anyway, the film is soooo colourful. The director deliberately highlights plenty of primary colours to make it look like a 'living comic book.' Pretty cool really!And, just like so many comic books, it's totally over the top. You really will have to suspend your disbelief and appreciate that nothing is really going to be particularly 'realistic' here. The blood is over the top, the character design is over the top and the gore is very over the top. In fact, it might be worth noting that there's a few scenes of quite graphic torture and you may need a strong stomach to get through them!Mikkelsen has to protect the compulsory damsel in distress, played by a (practically unrecognisable!) Vanessa Hudgens (in fact, I didn't even know it was her until I saw her name in the end credits!). While the head villain is played by British comedy actor Matt Lucas, who's clearly enjoying himself as a 'Little Britain' style villain.There's plenty of great (and, as I've said, over the top) action and my favourite scene was the one with the 'green lasers.' You'll have to watch it to see what I mean, but it reminded me of the 'best' scene from Arnie's 'Eraser' film. There's a team of cool badguy assassins who are on Mikkelsen's case and I would have liked to see more of them really.It is quite a long film and maybe it could have been edited down here and there, plus there are about two scenes where I really did have to suspend my disbelief a little too much to get through it (both involved scores of totally incompetent henchmen being totally unable to hit Mikkelsen even when they have many clear shots on him). However, those are just minor gripes. Overall, 'Polar' is a lot of fun and even makes me want to see what the comics are like. Great fun, just sit back, put your brain 'on hold' and enjoy (especially if you're a fan of other similar movies like 'Shoot 'em Up' and the 'Crank' series).",positive
"Warning spoilers. Overall, this movie starts well but eventually descends into a more mundane finish with a sort of interesting twist that seven so still felt unfinished.This Netflix production of the assassin genre presents a youthful, techno-film (with a distant resemblance initially to some of the art work from last year's Spider-man: Into the Spider-Verse). This film then commingles with a more sedate, independent movie cinematography. In some ways this movie is a sadistic, serio-comedic, over-the-top dramatization to shock audiences into a sort of mesmerized state of fetish rapture. However, for other audience members, this movie might just come across as a raw, immoral mess of juvenile hyperactive crap. Then at the same time the more tender, slow-paced reflective element that supposedly dominated the film a lot of the movie while the techno-fireworks became at first more of an interlude to keep the pace of the movie going to sustain some captivated interest in the movie for those who liked hyper-energetic action. Though the more sedate thread of this movie isn't without its own gory flashbacks that at times is used for a weird humorous sort of shock effect. The addition of a giftt that can also be lethal is also a bit incongruous to a more likely relationship scenario (though such a present could be deduced as a consistent part of the movie where the audience is forced to take the deeper mental leap of logic regarding the earlier scenes of fear which the script could have made some effort to clear up in a more compelling dramatic way on film). Taken together, the humorous flashback and gift scenes results in losing some of movie's the more intriguing and appealing authentic tone. However, the time and how the female neighbor's story is revealed is very well executed. Then the use of the mother and her son in another earlier scene introduced a new creative and innovative level of qualitative emotive, ripping tension to the assassin film genre.It is when both storylines in this movie that the resulting collision attempts to create a more dynamic third look to the movie, except it seems to become an almost too incredible beginning scene that wasn't sufficiently forecast to the audience. It's as if the scriptwriter didn't even know how to explain away this scene except just to make it into some spontaneous thrilling action scene. Nevertheless, by the middle section of the movie, a sweet desire for revenge is amplified by the audience's highly motivated need for retribution of sicko assassins and how it is resolved would probably be encouraged by a loud cheerleading squad of audience participants. Conveniently, as well as the trailers reveal, this movie extends itself to the typical kidnapping rescue scenario (Taken, 2008). Then there is the overly quick, uninspiring, unconvincing takedown of our leading character, especially considering how supposedly astute he has been and supposed to be. A lot of the second half of the movie is a sort of cruel repeat of the first part of the movie with the addition including many brief shots of intensive, gross amounts of physical torture, suffering, and mayhem along with scenes of induced involuntary drug addiction leading up to another predictable crescendo of action and retribution. The ensuring physical battles don't quite have the elegance nor the finesse as Hitman: Agent 47 (2015), Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003) or The Bourne Identity (2002), especially some of them shot in the mostly dark dungeon of sorts like of how the fight scenes in the over-rated The Dark Knight (2008) were photographed. Some of the scenes even become more like repetitive, unconvincing video game combat and martial art kill shots where you the character seemingly almost never dies. By the end, the movie has lost its originality and the hoped for amazing twist just seems to be a cute afterthought that seems to go nowhere, except for the unlikely sequel.Other similar movies include The Prince (2014) especially with Bruce Willis in his antagonist role; Tokyo Tribe (2014) for its sadistic stylized Japanese gang violence; Dune (1984) for its evil Baron Harkonen. Also V for Vendetta (2005) is another nicely stylized, polished movie about revenge on a huge scale. Interestingly, this movie also has an echo of the ultimately lone hero from the sci fi movie Oblivion (2013) and Hanna (2011) about an adolescent female assassin.",positive
"I can confidently say I wouldn't have watched this had it not been a recommendation. I don't like action films and I don't like Mads Mikkelsen so it was doomed to fail from the start.As the credits rolled I was immediately impressed however by the cinematography. It's not just how stylish it all was, it's the alarmingly competent use of color. The whole movie looks fantastic and that I certainly didn't expect.Furthermore Mikkelsen was great, this is the first movie I've enjoyed him in. The rest of cast also delivered with Hudgens once against demonstrating that she is a competent little actress and putting High School Musical (2006) behind her.Matt Lucas however as the villain in a serious Hollywood action film? That I didn't see coming and I'm very torn over it. Sure he did a great job, but it's still Matt Lucas he still looked out of place and in that getup all I could think of was Little Britain's ""Only gay in the village"" character.It tells the story of a soon to be retired assassin who finds himself a target of his own organization. Therefore we're talking high octane action, gore and rather offensively silly over the top gun play/fight sequences that you certainly need to leave your brain at the door for.So decent cast, great looking, suitably scored, so why the little over average rating? Well for a start it's still a mindless action film, it's still far from original and all the style and gloss can only take it so far. Furthermore there is a sequence involving a dog in the early moments of the film that was senseless, unforgivable and just shouldn't have been. For me one single scene can damage a film and for Polar that was such a scene.A competent action film that would have had 7/10 if it weren't for that one stupid moment.The Good:Impressive castVery stylishThe setting is beautifulExcellent use of colorThe Bad:Immediate minus a point for one of the awful opening scenesStill just a dumb action flick",positive
"Wow, there's so much one can say about this film. I believe this is one of those films you're either going to love or hate. Let's face it, this is not the type of film you can recommend to anyone, and definitely is an acquired taste.Let's go with the positive notes first. The cinematography is absolutely STUNNING. The settings are great, and the photography is amazing! Note the interesting use of color in the film, especially bright yellow. I'd actually like to know the director's reason behind accentuating yellow. For a film with such a dark theme, it had a very bright look. The visuals are fantastic. Mads Mikkelsen is sensational as the antagonist/protagonist. He reminded me so much of Logan Marshall-Green in 'Upgrade'.The film is extremely gory and brutal, though, but I suppose one should rather view it as satire, as it is done in a very satirical manner. Both satirical and sick, actually. Although 'Polar' is filmed like a comedy, it is a very, serious film. It also offers a shocking twist I never saw coming.In general, this film is just WOW, WOW, WOW!! I've never seen anything like it before, thus making it a truly unique film. If you can stomach the brutal and torture scenes, you definitely will appreciate this vengeance tale. The brilliant ending leaves the door wide open for a sequel, and frankly, I can't wait!",positive
"My goodness, was this a movie of high violence or not, i ask. stipid quest,cause it is one of the most very well acted,very good use of humou and irony, the hammering action and killings are not left to the viewer to imagine . it gives you all from beating,shooting,slaying,decapitations,bombs. you really just sit there and gets it all served without asking. its a gruesom flick,but i can assure you that its top notch acting,very good filming and editing,super duper gore and a lot of revengefull bloodspater etcetera.mads mikkelsen have the jean reno look and behaviour,and just makes this a brilliant action thriller comedy. i liked it very much and do recommend it very much..",positive
"Polar (1.5 out of 5 stars).Polar is a cheesy neo-noir action film that tries to be stylistic with its direction and action. But the end result is it being really cheesy and terrible. The films plot is a boring one about an assassin coming close to retirement Duncan (Mads Mikkelsen) were his agency decides to tie up loose ends by setting him up to be killed. Duncan befriends his neighbor Camille (Vanessa Hudgens) were she is estranged and distant about her past but is obsessed on trying to get to know Duncan.The film's direction is horrible. It tries playing for cheesy laughs, tries to get stylistic with its violence, and being flashy with its annoying characters. None of it is entertaining. The opening scene with Johnny Knoxville playing a retired assassin who is being hunted by a rogue group that has their own signature look. The dialogue is stupid and cheesy. It is not even funny. Plus the gratuitous nudity felt like the director was obsessed in capturing those shots.The plot was dull. The villain played by Matt Lucas was annoying and boring. Mads Mikkelsen was okay playing his character. Vanessa Hudgens felt a little out of place.The action sequences were tedious. There was only one cool hallway fight scene that got very bloody which was the only thing worth mentioning. Overall, Polar is a terrible film.",negative
"Novice (mainly music videos and short film - only a handful of full length feature films) director Jonas Åkerlund, and novice screenwriter Jayson Rothwell, did an outstanding job creating a crazy action noir film adaptation from the graphic novel by Víctor Santos.The directing was outstanding - props to Jonas Åkerlund for nailing this one. The great cinematography and use of high-contract colors really added to the film, as did his camera work. The screenplay's use of character introductions - although done many times before, worked really well, and combined with the writing and directing, gave this film a Quentin Tarantino feel.At first I felt the characters were way too animated and overshadowed Mads Mikkelsen's monotonic and bland character, and thus was disappointed in this film. But as the story progressed, I felt this wasn't your typical 'assassin retires' movie. The story developed slowly, and I do feel the 118 min length was a little long, but the pace kept up well, help keep me interested and intrigued, and eventually found myself to start liking it.The actors where cast perfectly and performed really well . The soundtrack by Deadmau5 was perfect for this film.I wanted to hate this B-grade film, but ended up loving it! This is one of those films that stay with you long after you've seen it, and I feel in time will become a cult classic. I do hope for a part 2 - and judging by some unexpected and surprisingly well placed surprises, I'm guessing that will happen.The critics got this one wrong. Yes, it may not be for everyone, but going in not expecting much, I became a fan. A well deserved 8/10 from me. And if anyone thinks this is a fake review, click my username and you will see my 300+ reviews. :)",positive
"Nice little flick about a bunch of psyko pro killers with Mikkelsen and some other familiar faces. For sure no masterpiece and not inventing the wheel new but solid action with some funny and grotesque moments and ideas.Good one for you if you like such movies like Hotel Artemis, Bad Times at the El Royale, John Wick, Wanted, The Equalizer etc.",positive
"What we have here is the typical hitman who wants to retire at a peaceful place but unlike the usual stuff where our hitman's wife/girlfriend gets killed or where he is pulled into the ugly job to save a kid or some redemption...Mikkelsen did a pretty good job with the action choreography n he is in good shape in this film.Is he obsessed with the eye patch? (Remember Valhalla Rising).This film has lots of violent action scenes, machine gun scenes but nothing memorable cos we have seen it all before. Good amount of sex scenes with eye candy boobs.The hallway fight scene reminded me of Iku Uwais' films.Equalizer, John Wick, Raid Redemption, Man from Nowhere,.... we have seen it all but it doesn't get stale if u can pull it off well n Polar succeeded in it.A pretty enjoyable action flick with top notch cinematography n choreography.",positive
This is not a good movie. It basically relies on stylized frenetic direction instead of script and talent to move the film alone.The direction is so filled of needless cuts that your eyes will be bugging out. The plot is standard fare but the script is horrible. It's boring beyond belief.,negative
"Beware: EXCESSIVE VIOLENCE. Although it is violence being portrayed in a cartoonesque (graphic novel) kind of way, but it is still quite cheap and repulsive violence, meant to be funny, but it isnt really...The story: an old hit man (actor Mads Mikkelsen) retires. But he gets asked to do one more job. That's a story we have seen a trillion times before. What's different about this one?The good: excellent acting performance by Mads Mikkelsen as an old hit man. There is more good to be found in a playful direction style, with excessive violence, which is still impressive to watch, however repulsive and cheap it is simultaneously.Any bad? It is not really funny, but it is not seriously dramatic either. It's only made to shock the viewer with graphic violence. The supporting actors are NOT credible and rather mediocre, at best. Mat Lucas is definitely miscast. That's a real disappointment.There is more wrong: the story is a formula, which has been told many times before, no real surprises there. The story and it' s characters are very shallow and without any real chemistry between them. One time watch...but for that one time it is still enjoyable enough...",negative
"Editing decisions and tonal problems undermine any good work that Mads Mikkelsen is doing.Mikkelsen is Duncan Vizla, a hitman whose agency turn on him as his 50th birthday is approaching in order to save paying him the extensive pension that he's accrued over the years. Though Vizla is haunted by dreams from an earlier hit that didn't go as planned, he's not willing to go quietly into the night and attempts to turn the tables on the gang of younger assassins that are sent to retire him permanently.There's almost two films at play within ""Polar"". One, whilst never making it to the realms of ""Good"", is an acceptable, if derivative assassin story that see's Mikkelsen retreat to his isolated cabin, interact a little with his neighbour and await the time his would be killers launch their assault. It borrows liberally from other Assassin stories, particularly ""John Wick"" (at whose expense an early parody falls flat) and ""Leon"" as he establishes a non-standard relationship with a younger woman (this time played by Vanessa Hudgens). There is enough in all of this aspect of the film to make you care about the pair a little, they at least feel like real people, admittedly though where one of them has a very unusual job. When the film works at all (which isn't very often) it's when it leans into these aspects.Unfortunately, anything good there is undermined, vomited on and the buried in concrete by the other half of the movie. A witless, childish mess of colours, noises and actions that's principle demonstrated by the villains of the film. A hopelessly miscast, Matt Lucas is the films lead villain. His character a collection of sexual threats, odd perversions and a complete incapacity to think through a plan. Though given nothing to work with, he is, frankly, awful and is fortunately that more people won't see his Razzie worthy turn to have it be a contender next year. The rest of his gang of assassins is also a lowlight. Logically, the team should have a series of different skills but here they appear to have got their roles based solely on looking unusual. They, and the cavalcade of drug addicts, snuff film makers and morbidly obese characters they interact with are, I think, supposed to be funny and edgy. They are not, they are eye-rollingly awful.The potential that was present in ""Polar"" is squandered entirely by this desire to be quirky or offbeat. So much so that the film must be an early contender for worst film of the year.",negative
"The ""Zombieland"" films are definitely NOT movies for film snobs. They are mindless fun and violence...and this is NOT a complaint. As a tiny bit of a film snob myself, I do sometimes love seeing something this mindless....and it keeps me from becoming too pretentious. I strongly recommend this second one...because it's much of what you got in the first one and about as good.Unlike some sequels, this one, fortunately, was able to bring back the old cast. Now, ten years later, the group faces two problems....the group starts to dissolve into individuals and there is a new threat....worse, stronger and smarter zombies. Can they all manage to get back together and work together to defeat this new batch of baddies?By the way, if you do see this film, a couple things you need to know. First, it's very, very, very violent. Yes, at times it's almost cartoonish violence, but it has a lot of blood, guts and yecch! Second, do NOT turn the movie off before the credits roll...please watch all the credits. You'll see why.",positive
"DOUBLE TAP is a ten-years-later sequel to ZOMBIELAND. I hated the first film and this follow-up, which offers more of exactly the same, is similarly routine and unenterprising. Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson are back in another road trip tale involving kooky assorted characters and random zombie action, but it's a typical slacker comedy and typically unfunny as a result. The stars try hard with irreverent one-liners and comic interplay, but the jokes fall flat time and again and none of the situations along the way are any good either. When the best part is a mid-credits joke sequence with a cameoing Bill Murray you know your film's in trouble.",negative
"It's been a few years. The gang decides to set up camp at the White House. Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) is tired of Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson)'s fatherly advices. Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) proposes to Wichita (Emma Stone) which only drives her away. The sisters leave and Little Rock finds pacifist Berkeley (Avan Jogia), a boy at her own age. Columbus finds clueless Madison (Zoey Deutch) who had been hiding in a freezer at the mall. Little Rock runs off with Berkeley and Wichita goes in pursuit joined by the boys and Madison. Tallahassee encounters fellow Elvis fanatic Nevada (Rosario Dawson) and doppelganger Albuquerque (Luke Wilson). Columbus has his own doppelganger Flagstaff (Thomas Middleditch).The original is irreverent fun. This one has the gang returning along with some very funny new side characters. This might have a few more laughs than the first one. I really like Madison and I wish she stayed with the group from start to finish. She's great at needling Wichita and the Uber bit is hilarious. The funniest bit has to be the introduction of Albuquerque and Flagstaff and I laughed hard. I would do some different things with the ending but I do like the Buffalo Jump.

The film has all of the regulars (Bill Murray in a flashback) and addition cast was great especially Zoey Deutch who stole all the scenes she was in as a near mindless individual.They make references to events in the first film as if you have seen it.Great mindless fun. I even caught the Steinbeck reference.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity,positive
"Just the beginning intro and what they did to the Columbia lady ... is worth watching this! And when you get hyped right from the start, this is a good sign. The signs of the zombie apocalypse may not be good, but the fun you can have with this one are quite something. And while we get our remaining/surviving character from the first movie, we also get some very cool new characters!They may seem annoying at times, but that's why they are also very funny. I was also annoyed by Bill Murrays character/fate/stupid decision that was not funny at all, in the first movie ... so I get it, if you feel the same about characters in this one. I think it worked here though, give it a shot - oops. Well you know what I mean. If you liked the first one, you hopefully will appreciate the time they took to get it right",positive
"This is another fun outing from the original ""Zombieland"" crew, reuniting all four principals from the first movie and adding a couple of ancillary characters. I'm not particularly a fan of zombie flicks, some take themselves way too seriously. But I do enjoy spoofy, absurd humor and this one has it in spades. The film takes a minor detour to Graceland paying homage to the memory of Elvis Presley, and as an Elvis imitator, Woody Harrelson isn't too bad when he doesn't have to sing. Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) takes a minor detour in the romance department as well, before finally sealing the deal with girlfriend and fellow traveler Wichita (Emma Stone). Zombieland newcomer Zoey Deutch plays the part of a clueless Valley Girl to perfection, even if she does hail from Madison. Searching for that perfect Zombie Kill of the Year, Tallahassee (Harrelson) and company find their big blowout at Babylon's Great American Zombie Jump. If you join in, prepare for an absurd amount of gore and squishy body parts, topped off by an out of the blue gratuitous appearance by Bill Murray both before and after the closing credits. While you're at it, get ready for a reworking of the 'rules for zombies', with a totally New Rule #1. Sorry, you'll have to watch the picture to catch it.",positive
"These comments are based on the assumption that people will have seen the first film so won't need introductions to the characters and their situation.Ten years have passed and Tallahassee, Columbus, Wichita and Little Rock have found a safe home... in the White House. Things soon change though; they may be safe from zombies but Wichita and Little Rock decide to leave. Wichita does return but not till Columbus has met another girl; the dim-witted Madison. Wichita is concerned because her sister has headed to Graceland with a hippy named Berkley. It is time to hit the road again to find her. Along the way they encounter plenty of zombies, of which there are now several different varieties.The original 'Zombieland' was a fun little film that didn't really need a sequel. That said this proved to be pretty enjoyable too. It never takes itself seriously and there are plenty of laughs, lots of often hilarious zombie killing and even some mild scares. The returning cast are all solid and there are some fun additions, most obviously Zoey Deutch as the less than bright Madison. I liked how the zombies have evolved into a variety of new types; the names they are given were pretty good too. There are some enjoyable running gags, such as their difficulty getting decent transport, and fun references to events in the first film. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of the original even if this isn't quite as good.",positive
"I'm a big fan of the first Zombieland movie: I dig the humour and love the characters, the excellent cast displaying great chemistry. However, something about the trailer for Double Tap made me fear the worst for this belated sequel: the comedy seemed forced and there was a distinct lack of zombie action. Would the magic still be there after a decade?The answer is 'yes'. And 'no'.It starts in fine style, with our four protagonists -- Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) -- killing zombies in gory fashion to Metallica's 'Master of Puppets', immediately allaying any fears I had about this being light on the splatter. The comedy seemed on point too, but things soon start to get a bit wobbly when the dynamic of the group suddenly changes: Wichita and Little Rock up and leave, and meet hippy Berkeley (Avan Jogia) on the road. Little Rock then abandons her sister, running off with Berkeley. Not much fun to be had here, since Berkeley is such an irritating character.Meanwhile, Columbus meets a bubble-headed blonde, Madison (Zoey Deutch), and is only too happy to satisfy her carnal needs. Fortunately, Deutch is a revelation, her ditzy bimbo routine lots of fun. When Wichita returns, she's none too happy to see that Columbus has a new squeeze, but teams up with the guys (and gal) regardless to find her missing sister, who has headed for Graceland.The following journey leads to an exciting altercation with some super-zombies (dubbed T-800s), a meeting with sexy, sassy Elvis fan Nevada (Rosario Dawson), and a clash of personalities with Tallahassee and Columbus doppelgangers Albuquerque (Luke Wilson) and Flagstaff (Thomas Middleditch), which for me was the weakest part of the film (it didn't make me laugh in the trailer, and it didn't make me laugh in the film).Fortunately, the film picks up for an exciting finale at hippie commune Babylon, where our heroes must do battle with a horde of ravenous T-800s, the crazy carnage involving a monster truck and a dangerous plan that takes place at the top of a high-rise building.All told, Double Tap is quite a mixed bag of stuff that works and bits that don't. Not essential viewing, but just about worth a watch for fans of the original.5.5/10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb.",negative
"Ten years ago I enjoyed ""Zombieland"", not as a great movie but suitably entertaining.Now, with COVID-19 threatening to alter the world forever and many people dying, what better time to enjoy this follow-up. I found it on BluRay from my public library.Well I didn't enjoy it at all. With the same main cast as the 2009 movie this one just doesn't work for me. The vicious killing of zombies just didn't seem funny, nor did the dialog. So I watched exactly 13 1/2 minutes of it before I ejected the disc. Maybe, if I had watched longer I might have gotten into it but I'll never know.For me this movie is a big miss.",negative
"Zombieland: Double Tap, while it being a zombie, wasn't really one that was just screaming for me to rush out to the cinema to watch. But still, I got a chance to watch it and sat down to do so. After all the 2013 ""Zombieland"" movie was good and this is a zombie movie after all.I will say that ""Zombieland: Double Tap"" is entertaining, but it wasn't a movie that was just overly outstanding. It is fun to watch, but as a sequel, then it was fairly mundane.It was good to see the characters again and have the cast return to reprise their roles, for sure. And the movie does have some new good performers on the cast list as well, such as the likes of Zoey Deutch, Rosario Dawson and Luke Wilson.The movie is definitely surviving a great deal on the many pop culture references and comedic jabs it throws at these. This was quite something that I enjoyed. However, this being a zombie movie, then I was disappointed to see how little a part of the movie that the zombies actually had. The zombies were a mere backdrop in the movie, serving little or no purpose, and had surprisingly little appearances in the movie. Sure, the scenes with the zombies were phenomenally nice to watch, both visually and also with the over-the-top presentation it had. But for a movie titled ""Zombieland"", then you need more zombies and have them play a more focal part of the storyline.Essentially, this was a road movie with a hint of coming-of-age seasoning. Not really what I was expecting or hoping to see. All in all, not a particularly outstanding movie, and hardly one that I will actually sit down to watch a second time. This movie was not as good as the predecessor.I am rating ""Zombieland: Double Tap"" a mediocre five out of ten stars.",negative
"I find the film really silly. The jokes are annoying, rather than funny. I did not enjoy it, even there is a star studded cast.",negative
"What ""Zombieland: Double Tap"" (*** OUT OF ****) lacks in originality, ""Venom"" director Ruben Fleischer and writers Dave Callaham of ""Expendables 3,"" along with Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick of ""Deadpool,"" more than compensate for with gratuitous gusto and sardonic hilarity. Mind you, ten years and one canceled 2013 pilot for a ""Zombieland"" television series later, Fleischer is back at the helm with returning scribes Reese and Wernick. Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin reprise their roles respectively as Tallahassee, Columbus, Wichita, and Little Rock from the 2009 original. Basically, things haven't changed that much during the intervening decade. Columbus still provides his witty voice-over narration and enumerates those changes since their last shenanigans. First, new strains of zombies are on the warpath, and Columbus describes them as T-800s (a homage to ""Terminators"" movies) because they are difficult to put down. Furthermore, three additional varieties are lurking out there in the apocalypse. Stupid zombies--referred to as Homers--chase butterflies and assault concrete statues. Some zombies have acquired partial smarts. For example, a zombie in a research lab pursues a doctor to an elevator. The zombie cannot access the elevator because the retinal scan doesn't recognize it. Plucking an eyeball from a dead physician nearby, this contemplative zombie pulls a Wesley Snipes' stunt from ""Demolition Man"" (1993). Now, the scanner recognizes the dead physician's eyeball in the zombie's mouth. The elevator door opens, and the zombie munches the doctor! Lastly, 'ninja' zombies have evolved. Catching their prey off-guard, these nimble flesh eaters strike silently. You don't know you've been bitten until you hear yourself scream. Second, Columbus has gotten more adept with firearms. Tallahassee no longer craves Twinkies, but he has become a die-hard Elvis fanatic. Little Rock changes the most. She has given her sister the slip and absconded with a hippie guitarist. Predictably, Wichita sets out to find her. Like the original ""Zombieland,"" ""Zombieland: Double Tap"" is a road trip through Hades. Our heroes and heroines are almost as bloodthirsty as the ravenous undead. After ten years, Tallahassee, Columbus, and Wichita have gotten their act coordinated well enough to repulse hordes of zombies and blast these damned devils to smithereens. Growling and snarling with menace, these wretched souls charge them, and our trio take them down like tenpins. Nerdy Columbus has gotten really handy with a pump-action shotgun, and Tallahassee revels in the carnage. One of the reasons Little Rock parted company was she wanted to live her own life without restrictions, especially from Tallahassee. Initially, when ""Zombieland: Double Tap"" opens, the quartet are hanging out at the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue. They live without a care about what's occurring outside until Wichita embarks on her search for Little Rock. Before she departed, Tallahassee gave Little Rock the gift of a chrome-plated .45 caliber Colt pistol. However, this was no ordinary automatic, but the gun that Elvis Presley gave to President Richard Nixon. As annoyed as Little Rock became about Tallahassee hovering over her like a surrogate father, she accepts the firearm.Like the original, Tallahassee and Columbus realize they've been left high and dry when Wichita hightails it to find her sister. In this instance, Little Rock has given Wichita the slip. Meantime, when the guys visit a mall near the White House, they stumble across one human who survived the zombie apocalypse. Columbus encounters Madison (Zoey Deutch of ""Vampire Academy""), who has been hiding in a freezer at the mall. Decked out in pastel pink, this sex-starved, scatterbrained blonde babe embraces her inner bimbo with unbridled abandon. Columbus and she have an affair in progress when Wichita returns after having broken up earlier with Columbus. Wichita left Columbus because he refused to put sticky notes on the eyes of Abraham Lincoln's portrait in the Lincoln Room of the White House while they made love. Now, Wichita is jealous. Since they have left the White House, Tallahassee decides to follow Little Rock to Elvis Presley's mansion in Graceland. Accordingly, Tallahassee is shattered when they cruise up to the dark, abandoned dwelling. Careening off into the distance, they wind up spending the night at The Hound Dog Hotel. Another Elvis enthusiast, Nevada (the curvaceous Rosario Dawson of ""Sin City""), owns this place. How this lady has survived alone in the wilderness of Tennessee is a mystery never adequately explained.One day, Nevada's two friends, Albuquerque (a Stetson clad Luke Wilson of ""Idiocracy"") and his sidekick Flagstaff (Thomas Middleditch of ""Replicas"") arrive in a monster truck to warn her about those tenacious T-800s. Some of those undead dastards storm the Hound Dog, and our heroes and heroines tangle with them. Director Reuben Fleischer has field day depicting zombies getting their heads obliterated as our heroes wield their hardware with devastating accuracy. Afterward, they learn about the Babylon commune, where people have gone to live in peace and harmony. These hippie types have fortified a high-rise, tower-shaped motel. Moreover, they have melted down their firearms and have deluded themselves into believing that the zombies won't bother them. The grand finale transpires in this resort setting with Tallahassee, Columbus, Wichita, and Madison tracking down Little Rock and her stoner boyfriend (Avan Jogia of ""Shaft"") nicknamed Berkeley who have sought refuge in Babylon.Basically, if you've seen zombie movie, you've seen them all. Director George A. Romeo reinvented the genre with ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1968), and Edgar Wright's ""Shaun of the Dead"" (2004) added laughs to the nihilist formula. Clearly, the success of ""The Walking Dead"" (2010) television series has also influenced even Fleischer's film with its finale in a commune. The camaraderie of our heroes and heroines keeps ""Zombieland: Double Tap"" fresh and captivating after ten years, and that's saying a lot for this gory horror comedy with its double-digit zombie casualty list. Oh, yes, don't skip out on Bill Murray's scene-stealing end credits cameo during the publicity tour of ""Garfield 3"" when he imitates a cat coughing up a hairball!",positive
"Ten years after the events of the first Zombieland movie, our heroes - Tallahassee, Wichita, Columbus and Little Rock - are enjoying life in the White House. Then, all of a sudden, Wichita and Little Rock leave. Wichita eventually returns but Little Rock is charting her own course. Tallahassee, Wichita and Columbus set out to find her, accompanied by Columbus's new girlfriend, of sorts, Madison.The first Zombieland, released in 2009, was great. The plot was a bit random (though its rambling nature had a certain charm) but it was the dialogue that made it so good: very funny and delivered perfectly. Some other great comedic devices rounded off a very funny movie.Zombieland: Double Tap follows in these footsteps with some great lines and comedic moments. Woody Harrelson (as Tallahassee), Emma Stone (Wichita), Jesse Eisenberg (Columbus) and Abigail Breslin (Little Rock) are in fine form again. Zoey Deutch is great as the beautiful but dim-witted Madison.The film does struggle a bit towards the end though. For 80% of its duration it was a great comedy with very little ambition to be a serious zombie-drama but towards the end it starts to take itself too seriously. What follows is a fairly conventional and flat period of action-drama. Almost made me knock the film down to a 7. Stuck with the 8, but a weak 8.",positive
"It's been 10 years without much changing. The sisters leave because they feel trapped in their situation. One month later, Wichita(Stone, impeccable) returns to tell the guys that Little Rock(Breslin, the only of the four main cast to return who doesn't get that much funny stuff to do) left her for a hippie, something all three of them find to be a problem. Can he protect her when he's taken a vow of nonviolence? Tallahassee(Harrelson, his desire for a Twinkie replaced with an obsession with Elvis that is a lot easier to milk, and they do, and it is glorious) in particular hates the idea of his adoptive daughter, clearly still 12 years old in his mind, being with someone he considers not right for her. So they leave to catch up to her. Thing is, Columbus(Eisenberg, ever OCD), in the time spent away from the girls, got together with Madison(Deutch, stealing the show. They keep coming up with new material for her, which makes her remain a laugh riot for much longer than you might otherwise expect. All of her screen-time, in fact), who's... let's go with ""not exactly the smartest"". They can't just leave her behind... well, despite a 2-to-1 vote in favor of that, they don't. So we get a lot of great bickering between the two now bitter exes, something both actors nail, while the blonde in the middle doesn't realize it's going on at all.Like Ant-Man and The Wasp and Deadpool 2 before it, clearly they watched the first movie repeatedly, figured out what worked the best and how to reference everything people loved about the original. This is hilarious from start to finish. This came out a decade after what it's a sequel to, and not everyone will find it to live up to that long wait. It doesn't try to be a carbon copy, or take huge risks so as not to alienate core fans waited for so long, but focuses on interpersonal relationships, which I would say was the right way to go. It's scarier, the jokes are more plentiful, it has more action and the character moments ring true.I recommend this those who have wanted this since 2009, as long as you can accept that it's not going to live up to having been wished for, for so long. 8/10",positive
"Our four haphazard and somewhat foul-mouthed friends - mouthy Tallahassee, nerdy and uber-careful Columbus, cute but wilful Wichita and kid sister Little Rock - are living in zombie-free near-harmony in the White House. But 10 years have passed and Little Rock, no longer little, fancies some company of her own age (subtext: male company) so the two girls head out on their own. The men follow once Columbus has finished some serious moping (he had proposed to Wichita theprevious evening), but only get as far as picking up the gorgeous but empty-headed Madison before returning to the White House. Wichita arrives back - nose out of joing at the speed of Columbus' rebound - and the group of four set off in pursuit of Little Rock and the cheesy pacifist singer/songwriter she has taken up with.Much as I really like the original four, the new characters introduced here, particularly the hilariously dim Madison and the strangely familiar Albuquerque and Flagstaff, add hugely enjoyable additional dynamics to the interpersonal relationsips. The device of posting graphics of Columbus' rules is continued, but with a couple of wrinkles, and is as funny and effective as before.It is hugely violent, it is full of swearing, and it is very, very funny. If you liked the first one, you'll like this one as much if not more.",positive
"I think it was Sadé who sang, ""it's never as good as the first time."" That was my overall sentiment after watching Z'land: Double Tap.The first Zombieland was so novel, fresh, and new that I loved it in spite of not being an Emma Stone fan. In this edition everyone is ten years older and they're in the same scenario being the same types of characters. Whereas Woody Harrelson's character can be the same after ten years (surly, shoot 'em up, cowboy), Eisenberg's character is annoying after ten years. He's pushing 40 and he's the same chatty, finicky, borderline wuss. He failed to draw a laugh and his character isn't as cool ten years into a zombie apocalypse.With a movie as good as the first Zombieland, what could they do for encore? Well, much like TWD did, they added relationship drama. Ugh. When zombies aren't excitement and drama enough why not throw in there a petulant teen that wants to fly the coop and a long standing couple that are in the fighting stage that now need something to remind them that they love each other. We got that and two highly annoying additions.Madison (Zoey Deutch) and Berkeley (Avan Jogia).Madison was a blond. That's all that needs to be said. Berkeley was from Berkeley. That's all that needs to be said. They were both the stereotypical representations of blonds and Berkelians respectively. And they both got way too much screen time. They were characters which are great as comic relief in a small dose, but nothing worthy of significant screen time. They got significant screen time.Z'land: DT had its moments but I just wasn't feeling it. I thought it was going to be great because of its predecessor and well... it's never as good as the first time.",negative
"I can't believe someone recommended Zombieland: Double Tap to me, much better than the original they said. It doesn't go anywhere interesting at all, the hell?The original's a popcorn flick, but decent. This is just more of the same, without any character development. It's too damn self-aware and Jesse Eisenberg's just bloody annoying. The Luke Wilson, Thomas Middleditch and Rosario Dawson part's just crap.",negative
"After moving on with their lives, the group of friends decides to get back together and head out into the zombie-filled world they left behind to save them, meeting not just other survivors to adapt to their family but a deadlier strain of zombie that endangers everyone around them.This was a solid and serviceable follow-up. The film's at it's best with the continued storyline of the characters once again as they continue to survive. That this goes into the various individuals in the group and gives each one their storyline to help show their growth and evolution over time that just so happens to take place during a zombie apocalypse makes for a fun time here. From the proxy-father figure teaching the kids how to grow up and make their lot in life to realizing the need for independence and leaving the nest to a surrogate marriage and how to deal with someone new that might disrupt their relationship, these are all given plenty of time to play out within the context of continuous zombie ambushes that are woven into the film which also forces along their relationships in a great, interconnected puzzle. That these are fun and enjoyable while getting the characters plenty to like about each other is what makes these so much fun. That also goes hand-in-hand with some decent zombie encounters. The hard-hitting opening that shows the group blasting through the zombies in their march to the White House gets this started on a perfect note as everyone gets to shine blasting them in the face with high-tech weaponry. Along the way, scenes like the battle in the mall where they pick up the other survivor, the caravan finding the zombies at the parked tour-bus or the missing sister finding the running zombies along the way get this one going with a solid series of action scenes out on the road. As well, the fantastic confrontation at the motel is impressively choreographed and incredibly fun, keeping this one moving along at a great clip with the road-movie aesthetic keeping this moving to new locations to battle the zombies before getting to the high-quality finale which is the confrontation at the sanctuary against the enhanced zombies featuring tons of action and lots of fun gore. With the comedy still quite funny and quite appropriate for the tone of the film here, there's a lot of positive aspects at work here. There are a few issues with this one. The biggest problem here is the randomness of the inserts to try to be meta in how this approaches the time they've been together. Making up names for the zombies based on pop-culture celebrities, doing random insert shots of people around the world attempting to pull off incredibly elaborate, convoluted, over-the-top and impossible-to-pull-off in any realistic sense type of kills on zombies come off trying to be quite hip and fresh. However, these end up disrupting the flow of the main storyline involving the group going out for their friend by doing these cutaways and inserts to people around the world in the middle of a zombie apocalypse. As well, the main reliance on setting up the romance angle for everyone makes for a pretty suspenseless time because everyone is bound to end up with a partner, rendering their encounters meaningless due to keeping the relationships intact. However, these here aren't detrimental and don't hold it back much.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.",negative
"As with the first part from *ten years ago*, this is a mix of people being awkward for comedy, zombies running around like headless chickens and the suspense only romantic comedies can generate, plus some cameos. It's clear everybody had fun, so I am not sorry I watched the film, but in the end it had no real purpose.",negative
"In a world ruled by the dead, we are forced to finally start living. Robert KirkmanThe original Zombieland was pretty amusing; the current Zombieland: Double Click not so much. Give director, co-writer Ruben Fleisher credit for the original and its sequel: The original cast members are enthusiastic Zombie crushers with a subtext of cohesive, if sometimes feisty, family members determined to keep the family intact despite the danger out-of-control zombies pose.Especially because the new generation of zombies is much more resistant to the old ways of eradicating them (guns, fire, folding chairs, etc.) are less effective. Adding Marilyn-Monroe-type blonde airhead Madison (Zoey Deutch) to the regular family doesn't always increase their effectiveness in eradicating the brainless devils, but she sure is funny.It is fun to watch ersatz-paterfamilias Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) still loving his guns, and nerdy, clueless Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) get it on seriously with Wichita (Emma Stone, in a thankless role for an Oscar lady), just to name a few. Beyond the silly repetition of head bashing and easy liberal-conservative warfare is the enduring need to keep the family together, given that Little Rock (Abagail Breslin) has taken off with, egads! a liberal hippie, Berkeley (Avan Jogia). You can imagine how that union energizes Tallahassee to save her.Races to escape the hungry zombies, tossed off cultural quips, and family squabbling are staples of this now franchise. It's all amusing in a low-level way. Satisfying would be if the figurative meaning of brainless Americans devouring their fellow Americans were fleshed out, so to speak. But, hey, a wacky Woody as patriarch is worth a bit of relaxing time.""I have nothing against hippies, I justwant to out of 'em."" Tallahassee",positive
"Well, this is rare, though not unheard of: A Sequel WAY better than its original.Haven't seen the original Zombieland in over 10 years and all I remember of it was that I gave it 3/5 stars and while I liked it, I HATED the girls. This is NOT normal for me. In fact, I love badass women in cinema, probably 10x more then the men. Just not here. I HAAAAATED these girls and if the worst decisions that could be made, especially in a Zombie apocalypse, everyone made them in the first movie.Here, somehow, I've forgiven the girls, aside from the obnoxious new one, and thought this was actually funnier than the first one. All bad decisions, still made, though.In real-time, it's 10 years post the first film and our four survivors are living in luxury within the White House when the youngest runs off with a hippie. The remaining trinity race after her only to be attacked by (sadly) evolving zombies.Thank Goodness the rest of the movie isn't as fake, though never perfect, but the opening was SOOO bad CGI, I was mildly tempted to turn this off. I HATE CGI blood, but this took it 10 steps worse than just the computer-generated blood.Mercifully, it gets much better and I loved the humor more this time around. While never bad in the original, I found myself laughing more this time than last. And it was nice the leading females weren't such horrible human beings this time around.I would recommend both, back-to-back and thankfully, you'll end on a higher note.***Final thoughts: Thank you, Living Legend Ghostbuster. Also, the stab to the Walking Dead, which I love that series 4x more than these movies, was perfect and the best line in the movie.",positive
"This fun zomedy sequel follows the further adventures of the folks from the first movie, which I saw long ago that I can't really compare it with this one.Anyway, this is about 90% comedy with a few action scenes. The action scenes I can take or leave, but the silly comedy is very funny, and Zoey Deutch is absolutely hilarious as a sexy airhead.I wouldn't say it's memorable, it hasn't got much of a story, but it's full of laughs.",positive
"I enjoyed this movie. it's nothing special from a story-perspective, but i was entertained and laughed a solid amount. even the parts that weren't laugh out loud funny were still amusing. nothing felt forced like it does when this much time has passed before a sequel. my favorite part of this movie was zoey deutch. she was HILARIOUS. ""on point"" is an understatement. she played it perfectly to the point where i became invested in her character even though she's supposed to be annoying (1 viewing, 3/21/2020)",positive
"Despite my love of all things 'zombie-related,' for some reason I never really 'got' the original 'Zombieland.' I thought it was okay, but, based on other people's opinions, everyone else seemed to love it while it just felt a bit run-of-the-mill to me. This sequel comes quite late in terms of capitalising off the original's success - a sign that it may not be up to scratch.Sure enough, it took a mauling from critics and kind of sank without a trace. Having watched it now, I can sort of see where the critics were coming from. The word I'd use to describe it is 'forced.' The first film ended and didn't really have much room to go in terms of carrying on the story. The four heroes of the first outing all return (rare for a horror movie!) and have decent enough chemistry as we find what's happened to them in this post apocalyptic undead-filled dystopia. There are jokes between them and most actually land. Yet the whole story seems to be based on one plot device after the other to set them up from their happy/safe beginnings and move them into danger.Characters split up. You know they're going to be back together by the end of the film. They are forced to move locations, leaving safety for more dangerous parts of America, simply because the story needs them to. And the zombies themselves have been 'beefed up.' The problem is, when you have expert zombie-killers as the main characters, then the undead are not particularly threatening. Trouble is, the 'souped-up' ghouls are little more intimidating than any that came before them.A new character, played by Zoey Deutch, was introduced. At first I thought she was quite annoying (at least she was supposed to be), but, by then end of the film, I realised that she had most of the best/funniest lines and I possibly wanted to see more of her!The zombie genre was popular in the seventies and eighties, but got done to death. However, when the 'Resident Evil' movies of the early 2000s brought the genre back from the grave we were given practically every type of zombie movie and spin-off we could ever want. 'Zombieland: Doubletap' is a horror/comedy with the emphasis firmly on laughs. There's not much gore here that you haven't seen before, but there's also not much you haven't seen before full stop. It's okay and an easy enough film to have on in the background, but you'd probably feel a bit cheated if you paid full price at the cinema for it.",negative
"The show starts in April 1912 with the news of the sinking of the Titanic. Robert Crawley, Earl of Grantham (Hugh Bonneville) has no son and the heir is on board. The new heir is distant cousin Matthew Crawley (Dan Stevens) who is a small Manchester lawyer. The easiest solution is to push oldest daughter Mary (Michelle Dockery) onto the new heir. Sibling rivalry can be cruel on plain middle daughter Edith (Laura Carmichael). The youngest Sybil (Jessica Brown Findlay) is sweet and independent.

The episodes move along quickly in intervals of months. It's about big dramas and delicious personalities. All of it anchored by great relationships whether it's Mary and Matthew or Bates and Anna. At this point, I hope the show ends properly and doesn't lose its way. It does tend to hit on the big historical points a lot. The big loss at the end of season 3 does concern me a little but that's the way of modern TV.",positive

"Created by Emmy winning and four-time nominated Julian Fellowes (Gosford Park, The Young Victoria, The Tourist), I had heard a lot of hype about this new British television period drama, very similar in concept to Upstairs, Downstairs, and I was very happy to watch it. Basically the series revolves around the lives of the residents and staff at Downton Abbey, the Yorkshire country house of the Earl and Countess of Grantham, and the story is set in the early years of the 20th Century. The aristocratic Crawley family are the head Robert Crawley (twice Emmy nominated, Golden Globe nominated Hugh Bonneville) and his American wife Cora (Emmy and Golden Globe nominated Elizabeth McGovern), eldest daughter Lady Mary (three-time Emmy nominated, and Golden Globe nominated Michelle Dockery), middle daughter Lady Edith (Laura Carmichael), the youngest daughter Lady Sybil (Jessica Brown), Dowager Countess and the Earl's mother The Right Honourable Violet Crawley (three-time Emmy winning and twice nominated, Golden Globe winning and nominated, and BAFTA nominated Dame Maggie Smith), Countess of Grantham, third cousin, once removed and heir presumptive to the title and estate Matthew (Dan Stevens) and Matthew's mother Isobel (Penelope Wilton). The servants of Downton are butler Charles Carson (four-time Emmy nominated Jim Carter), housekeeper Elsie Hughes (Phyllis Logan), Lord Grantham's valet John Bates (Emmy and BAFTA nominated Brendan Coyle), Lady Grantham's maid Sarah O'Brien (Siobhan Finneran), footman and later Lord Grantham's valet Thomas Barrow (Rob James-Collier), footman William Mason (Thomas Howes), head housemaid Anna Smith/Bates (three-time Emmy nominated, Golden Globe winning and nominated Joanne Froggatt), housemaid Gwen Dawson (Rose Leslie), housemaid Ethel Parks (Amy Nuttall), cook Beryl Patmore (Lesley Nicol) and kitchen maid Daisy Robinson/Mason (Sophie McShera). Through the series, with King George V ruling the country, and events like the sinking of the Titanic and the First World War, and innovations like electricity and the telephone, we see the various situations the characters are put into, such as relationships, changes to the house, financial difficulties, characters arriving and leaving and much more. Also starring Allen Leech as Tom Branson, David Robb as Dr. Clarkson, Lily James as Lady Rose MacClare, Kevin Doyle as Joseph Molesley, Zoe Boyle as Lavinia Swire, Iain Glen as Sir Richard Carlisle, Robert Bathurst as Sir Anthony Strallan, Samantha Bond as Lady Rosamund Painswick, Jeremy Swift as Spratt, Douglas Reith as Lord Merton, Paul Copley as Mr. Mason, Tom Cullen as Anthony Gillingham, Andrew Scarborough as Tim Drewe, Michael Cochrane as Reverend Travis, Matthew Goode as Henry Talbot, Robert Bathurst as Sir Anthony Strallan, Iain Glen as Sir Richard Carlisle, Rade Serbedzija as Prince Kuragin, Richard E.

All of the recurring actors are fantastic in their parts and in their own ways all make you warm to them, the costumes are fantastic and capture the period well, and the music in the series by John Luynn is great as well, if you like well acted, well scripted and well put together costume dramas, then you will definitely like this acclaimed series.

"This British TV series has gotten lots of attention here in the USA for the past season or two, I've only heard vague things about it, including some buzz that it had won some awards. So today, being a slow day in Southern Texas, cool and rainy, I looked into it and lo, I beheld that Netflix has the first season, 7 episodes, available for streaming on demand. So I took the plunge. I watched the first episode, approximately 65 minutes, and immediately watched the second, approximately 45 minutes.As the first episode opens we are shown that it is 1912, in the beautiful English country. I didn't attach too much to the date, other than it was just over 100 years ago, until a telegram came in, everyone seemed very concerned, and some began to ask of survivors. Then it hit me ... the sinking of the Titanic. That event is used as the catalyst for the series of stories that make up this English family soap opera.The immediate and great impact is that the two heirs of the estate featured here were among those lost at sea in the sinking of the ship. Since the gentleman of the estate had three daughters but no son, by British law the estate at his passing would go to the nearest of kin male, which happens to be a member of the working class, a lawyer and 3rd cousin once removed, someone the family doesn't even know.Of course there is much more to learn about the story, as I am only two episodes in, but already I can see why the series has such a following. The writing and acting are first-rate and the stories interesting. Thre are lots of interaction issues between the service staff down below and the family members above. In many ways I was reminded of the excellent movie ""Gosford Park."" Anyway I believe I am hooked, I don't believe I can ignore the rest of the episodes.In May 2013 I watched season 2 on DVD, and it was almost impossible to NOT watch the whole thing in one sitting. Really captivating, its main subject is WW1 and turning Downton Abbey into a recovery center for wounded soldiers. The series employs a historical adviser so it is reasonable to assume the stories, while fiction, are authentic.Over 3 days in July 2013 I watched the whole 3rd season on DVD, set in the 1920s. The more I watch it the more I enjoy it.The main setting for the series is Highclere Castle which is to the west of London, not far from the M4 and Newbury.",positive
"Well done to Downton Abbey. Launched without much fanfare it suddenly became a huge hit both here and across the globe. But it didn't stray away from the premise it had at the start and largely maintained its quality throughout the 52 episodes.Yes, it was a bit slow paced at times and not all the story lines were gripping, but for sheer entertainment and well crafted drama then the show is very much deserving of all the praise it receives.I think ITV will miss it and so in turn will the viewers. Despite people saying that we are living in a golden age of TV there is a shortage of good period dramas. Downton filled that void.Well done to all involved for going out on a high.",positive
"DOWNTON ABBEY is the kind of ""Masterpiece Theatre"" material that the British do with such finesse that one can only sit back and marvel at the sets, costumes, music, and above all, the performances that are all on an extraordinarily high level.The moment the first series ended, I wanted to see more--so no doubt I'll be ordering my copy of Season 2. Central among the gifted performers are Maggie Smith (as the Dowager Countess Violet), Hugh Bonneville as the Earl of Grantham, and Elizabeth McGovern as Cora, his American wife. But all of the lesser roles are played to perfection with special mention for Brendan Coyle as John Bates, Joanne Froggatt as Ana, Michelle Dockery and Laura Carmichael.Complicit in schemes involving wicked behavior are two of the downstairs help played brilliantly by Siobhan Finneran and Rob-James Collier as Thomas, both of whom cast a shadow over the household.The plot has dialog that is always witty and good for a quick chuckle or a gasp of disapproval and the character motivations are all played out in a convincing manner true to each person involved.Very compelling to view the fluid story unfold with its many sub-plots and shadings of the class warfare that existed in the U.K. then and now.Absolutely one of the most rewarding and richly satisfying shows from Great Britain that have come along in recent years. The color photography amid location settings create the proper atmosphere for the entire story which takes place just before WWI among a wealthy titled household undergoing some major changes inside the castle walls.",positive
"I was looking forward to this but I was disappointed. This series is overrated. Am I the only one who thinks this isn't all that? Firstly the good points - the setting and atmosphere are well done. The grand old historic home location is quite attractive.The WWI era setting should provide for interesting story lines but it all seems very clichéd. Very little happens in one season - the plot could have been covered in a third the time. The characters are one dimensional with simplistic good guys and bad guys. The nephew and heir Crawley and his mother are too goody two shoes and self righteous. The actress playing Lady Mary, Michelle Dockery isn't pretty and has a cold unappealing look with a blank expression. She isn't watchable. Not right for a leading role. The idealistic political daughter is annoying. Elisabeth McGovern as the Countess is a bit painful to watch with her crumpled looking expressions. Maggie Smith as the dowager Countess has good delivery as usual but she shouldn't have won an Emmy for that. It's hard to feel for any of the characters because they are so cardboard cutout.The ""help"" are way too clever and conniving it's unreal especially the evil butler. The story is weak and soap like. Only the last episode of season 1 had some forward momentum.I'll probably still watch it to see what happens but don't be fooled - it's well produced fluff masquerading as an adaptation of great literature.",negative
"I still don't know what the hoopla is all about with this series. It's a costume drama set in 1912 in fictional Downton Abbey where there are plenty of servants and an aristocratic family. The cast is first rate led by Dame Maggie Smith among others. She is a scene stealer. The costumes, art direction, and sets are first rate. I have seen other British dramas with costumes and sets. This drama doesn't seem much different and I'm surprised by its success. I believe class differences between servants and the family to which they serve is considerable. The servants can be cutthroat and vicious. Just look at poor Bates in the first episode. There is plenty of drama going on in the servants quarters while their employers worry about their futures of their three daughters where marriage is the only answer.",negative
"At the risk of sounding sentimental, I believe the monarchy stands for a fairness that we like to think represents us. I hope 'Downton Abbey' has a similar decency about it. - Julian Fellowes ""Downton Abbey's"" written by Julian Fellowes, a Tory peer, Baron, monarchist and husband-to-royalty, so right away you know it has a clear agenda. Restorative nostalgia to the max, and released to coincide with a fresh round of British austerity measures, the television series sees a family of early 20th century aristocrats living in a palatial estate and tended to by a sprightly band of servants. Sounds interesting? Forget Renoir's ""The Rules of the Game"", Altman's ""Gosford Park"", and the past 500 years of human history and social theory. No. In ""Downton Abbey"", the class system exists for the benefits of those at the bottom, and proves as bothersome to those unfortunate few at the top as it does those lower down the social hierarchy.Fellowes serves up the platonic ideal of an English aristocrat. Good, selfless and caring, our Lords and Ladys bend over backwards to serve their servants, graciously offering them jobs, assistance, compassion, awards and so forth. They are benign despots, all-powerful, their authority final, but more sage and caring than any elected politician could ever be. The rich, in other words, are socially responsible father figures. They are invested in their households, in their communities, and provide a far reaching social benefit; without the rich to mercifully protect them, the poor would be forced out into the cold to fend for themselves. Indeed, Fellowes frequently has his rich folk sacrifice their bodies, their status and their wealth for the servant class (joining war efforts, taking on limping servants etc). The message - rife with false binaries - isn't only that servants should be content with their roles, but that one, regardless of class, cannot and should not avoid servitude. Even the rich are servants to their fellowman.Significantly, the series' villains are all either homosexuals, socialists or members of the servant class. In the second series, villains become figures of new wealth; modern capitalists who don't respect the supposedly loving, symbiotic relationships of late aristocracy. As the series focuses on an individual household rather than systems, the nobility and selflessness of Fellowes' aristocrats justify the system in which they spin. It's a very classically conservative notion of history (in actuality, servants couldn't look at, let alone speak to their masters), a proudly hierarchical world in which all social conflicts and tensions are resolved without any restructuring of class relations. Stratification is posited as being natural, optimal and only the deviant or repellent are incapable of adapting or finding accommodation within it. No talk, of course, of where our Earls and Lords acquired their wealth, land enclosures, the lives of the impoverished outside the mansions or how the system's social relations hinge on an in-build bondage ingrained within ""economics"" (ie money) itself. Elsewhere the series brings up occasional Big Issues (war, feminism, Ireland etc), but only to engage in the smug, back-patting afforded by hindsight. This is a benign, liberal aristocracy, for an age of ""caring"" capitalists.All ""Abbey's"" arguments in favour for the class system were once put forth by George Fitzhugh, an American social theorist who published racial and slavery based sociological theories in the antebellum era. Fitzhugh essentially argued that Negro slaves needed ""strong white daddies to look after them"". That slavery ""protects the Negro"", ""ensured that blacks would be economically secure and morally civilised"" and that the evils of modern capitalism, which was gradually replacing slavery, would expose poor blacks to persecution and suffering. The new rich, Fitzhugh argued, were promoting a form of competition which would harm blacks. Afterall, the slave belongs to its owner, and owners take care of their capital, take care of what they own, provide them with food and shelter, unlike those pesky capitalists who merely rent labour. Fitzhugh even went so far as to defend slavery because ""capitalists are anti Negro racists, whilst slavery is not racist"".Fellowes is doing the same. Or rather, the arguments are always the same, no matter the social reconfiguration taking place. Hence, slavery is good because slave owners take care of their slaves, aristocracy is good because the aristocracy takes care of their servants, and capitalism is good because employees take care of their labourers. What each argument does, regardless of historical time period, is posit the lower classes as dependent on power without questioning how and why this power is structured, created and propagated in the first place.In the early 1980s, Immanuel Wallerstein, a renowned social scientist, outlined 12 characteristics which he believed were ""unique"" to modern world systems. His aim was to show that modern capitalism, in the affluent 80s, was a kind of ""step up"" from both the aristocracy of ""Downton's"" era and the feudalism of the distant past. By 1989, though, Wallerstein had completely reversed his position. All the presumably unique characteristics of the ""modern world system"" were also true of the medieval and ancient world systems. He could find no substantial distinctions that would satisfy his categorisations. The point isn't only that there were no clean transition from feudalism to aristocracy to capitalism as such, but that power proves capable of propagating itself.But why would a series which glorifies the class system, posits class hierarchies as inherently benevolent and idealises master/servant bonds, be suddenly so very popular? Why would a series about inherited privilege, ineluctable servitude, be popular in an era of Occupy, Austerity, Bank Bailouts and massive corporate tax dodging? Perhaps because ""Downton"" presents a Utopian version of the past for the purposes of painting, and thereby bolstering, a contemporary system capable of weathering any upheaval or shock. Or perhaps it's simply a severe form of Stockholm Syndrome.4/10 - See ""Remains of the Day"", ""Eyes Wide Shut"" and ""Never Let Me Go"". Worth no viewings.",negative
A lot people like wacthing boring TV shows I am not one of them sorry. come on now 10 for the total crap. This show has story lines that are awful. It is a slow boring show with no point to it other then to be really boring,negative
"I didn't watch this until after we visited the Biltmore in North Carolina. We went to the exhibit. My wife had already seen it and was crazy for the show.I watched it with her and the rest of the family when we came back, but I didn't enjoy it as much as they did so. I found it filled with over dramatizations. Too many maids and footmen marrying each other. Too many things happening at once.It wasn't terrible, I think historically they did a good job with the war and how the English life was during this period. The wealthy and their staff in massive mansions.Overall I recommend it for at least one viewing.",positive
".....""Downton Abbey"" sails across our screens on Sunday nights,flying the flag for nicely photographed,well - acted and expensively - produced if rather anodyne drama that can't possibly offend anybody. I rather hope its success doesn't signal a return to the 1970s fashion for comforting series set in the last days of Empire where pater has apoplexy every time he reads the newspaper and the aristos and staff represent a microcosm of English society. Written by Mr Julian Fellowes who knows whererof he speaks,""Downton Abbey"" is like a very large and fluffy chocolate cake,adorable in small slices but awfully indigestible as a whole.The usual upper - class knobs despair or revel in their upper - class knobiness according to their temperaments in direct proportion to their below - stairs equivalents.Hardly a ""Hold the Front Page"" moment,then. Set in 1912 so the last direct male heir to the Abbey can conveniently drown on ""Titanic"",the story concerns the future of the house and its occupants apparently at the mercy of an iniquitous law that maintains that title property cannot descend a female line. When the guv'nor goes what will happen to them all? Most of them seem so consumed with self - interest that I found it hard to care. The servants seem almost totally deeply unpleasant and are either bright and breezy or dark and brooding,the exception being the wonderful Miss Phylis Logan as the Housekeeper who also gives far and away the best performance. Despite all this I did enjoy ""Downton Abbey"" even though it may have been the enjoyment of the familiar and unchallenging where you could drop off for five minutes and never notice it. It's just a bit disappointing that in 2010 a TV production company,given a big budget,could not have been just a tad more daring. ""You rang m'Lord"" said all this so much better and with poignancy and humour,two qualities that I haven't found in ""Downton Abbey"".",negative
"There are Downton devotees and there are people who think it's a second-rate soap opera praising the oppressive class system of days of old. I'm in the middle ground: I like the show, but I cannot for the life of me comprehend the 8.8 rating it has on this website.I can certainly see the appeal: the production values are marvelous, from the costumes to the old-fashioned cars. The show's story is mostly the stuff of melodrama: scandals, sex, war, and family issues all on the grand scale. The character's, while not always likable, are an interesting bunch of people. I will admit though, sometimes the writing is weak and soap opera-ish (ex. Edith's wedding). Some of the characters are flat too.I don't think this show will be considered a classic in the long run, but it is solid entertainment.",positive
"If you thought Gosford Park needed to be a shallow, episodic TV series, you might enjoy this. Even Maggie Smith (and her character) has been borrowed wholesale to ease your transfer. And what luck, the theme music is a thinly veiled knock-off of the title music from The Piano. But Gosford Park wrestled with matters of substance, and showcased some striking film technique.This show is teeming with ""decent"" characters (translation: progressive) none of whom could have existed historically, and none of whom can inject the show with any surprises. The show shoots the bolt in the first two episodes where Lord Grantham defends and acts as co-equals with two different servants. Hooray for time-traveling with anachronistic values. The show never rises above soap opera by larding itself down with drippy conflicts, and boatloads of shallow female matters. The elevated estrogen level torpedoes any real intrigue.The drama in this is just so much sniveling.",negative
"GRADE: B-THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Despite its period grandeur, Downton Abbey is innocuous fun but emotionally inert.JIM'S REVIEW: Welcome to the party. The aristocratic Crawley clan is planning a soiree to welcome the King and Queen of England and you are invited to attend the big screen adaptation of one of the most popular television series ever made, Downton Abbey. You can be sure that this will be an opulent affair, filled with a hint of scandal and other surprises. While it's nice to see old friends, one needs to know not to outstay your welcome. This film adaptation lingers a tad too long, carrying on well after the stroke of midnight. There is much for the eyes on view and little for the heart. By all means, join the party, it's a fun time, but keep your expectations low.For fans of the series, this film will certainly be enjoyable; non-fans may ponder the characters and their relationships and wonder what all the hoopla about this stodgy family is all about. The period details are fastidiously in place, but the historical events of 1927 are rarely mentioned (Lindbergh's flight, talkies, Stalin), nor do they become part of the scenario as the series accomplished so deftly in its televised reign.Julian Fellows' screenplay lacks the character development and depth that made the television program so remarkable. He rolls out his roster of beloved figures, but they are not given equal ranking of importance in his story. He still has the talent for one-liners and compelling dialog, but his many subplots border more on melodrama and comic rifts.The film focuses more on the upstairs behavior dealing with the royal visit. Lord Crawley (Hugh Bonneville) and his wife Cora (Elizabeth McGovern) become mere background props in this film, with more screen time given to the younger and eldest members: Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery) is still the driving force of the estate, a forlorn Lady Edith (Laura Carmichael) looks for fulfillment, and former footman now an unwilling member of the ruling class, Tom (Allen Leech), searches for love. Violet, the Dowager Countess (Maggie Smith) and her clever sidekick, Lady Isobel (Penelope Wilton) still provide the catty put-downs with glee as the duo prepare to deal with the arrival of Violet's cousin (Imelda Staunton), who has a few secrets or two.The downstairs crew are not given much to do except run the household efficiently. The haughty Carson (Jim Carter) is brought back from retirement to organize all things proper and Mr. and Mrs. Bates (Brendan Coyle and Joanne Froggart) are overseeing the event, with Mrs. Patmore and Daisy (Leslie Nicol and Sophie McShera) scouring away in the kitchen. All are reduced to comic relief, especially a delightful Kevin Doyle as the socially inept Mr. Molesley, making their storylines seem slight. Except for Barrow (Robert James-Collier), the ambitious butler who has the most dramatic arc in the movie due to his repressed homosexuality and its illegality, the rest of the staff deal mostly with their duties and the invasion of the King and Queen's snooty servants. Their shenanigans are very entertaining, but trivial by comparison to their complicated lives depicted on the series.Some of this large talented cast is wasted in their sketchy backstories in Mr. Fellows' adaptation, with Matthew Goode given short shrift as Mary's husband, delivering just a cameo appearance. It's as if the writer just couldn't juggle any more complications to his overloaded storyline and cast of characters.That said, the actors are all back to reprise their roles for various reasons and they are splendid as always. Ms. Staunton is a wonderful addition to the ensemble and Ms. Smith and Ms. Wilton continue to enchant. Yet one wishes the film had more gravitas and dramatic tension. (A throwaway sequence involving an attempted assassination seems superficial and unconvincing.) Michael Engler's direction is straight forward. He keeps the action moving forward, yet doesn't deliver the creative flourishes that are needed to make the narrative resonate.Downton Abbey is innocuous fun, but it is all surface treatment and barely goes beneath the facade in its observation of class struggle, historical occurrences, and changing times. Granted, the pomp and grandeur are there on full display, although the dramatic substance is missing. (Kudos to Anna Mary Scott Robbin's gorgeous costume designs adding the perfect elegance and the music score by Mark Day providing a grand sense of pageantry.) Still, this flawed film remains a good time to be had, even when the party's over.",positive
"Until a few nights ago, I had never seen any episodes of Downton Abbey (for years I thought it was Downtown Abbey with an extra 'W').Anyway, BritBox just added the entire series. I had insomnia on Thursday night/Friday morning so I watched two or three episodes.My opinion for what it's worth: this is a mostly unremarkable period drama. It's basically an old-fashioned soap opera with fancy sets, costumes and cars. It doesn't really stand out to me with any sort of spectacularity. However, I will say it's perfectly cast and there is not one false note in the acting department. Still I think the direction keeps the action a little too restrained/subdued and in many ways this is just a formulaic retread of Upstairs Downstairs. Or is that Upstairs Donstairs.",negative
"As someone who enjoys British drama and historical fiction, I could hardly pass up this series when it began. I know not everyone enjoys this type of television entertainment laid on with a large dose of deluxe settings and costumes. Keeping this in mind, I will admit I was a easy catch for the marketers of this spectacle. I admire how the creators of the series have produced a story from the Edwardian period that draws on the theme of the Upstairs Downstairs television series from the 1970's. The 1992 movie Gosford Park is closer in style with its cinematography and costumes than the television series, which was marked by fine acting and simple stage sets. The script is very well written and acted. Maggie Smith plays a character similar to her role in Gosford Park. Julian Fellowes, the scriptwriter for Gosford Park, also wrote the script for this series. The actors in Downton Abbey also include Hugh Bonneville, the Earl of Grantham and master of the estate, who resists change but in his personal life, often bends over backwards to break out of the cast of a cold aristocrat. His daughter Mary, played by Michelle Dockery, begins her role as the arrogant and beautiful daughter, who is adored by the staff. Her life and her attitudes evolve as she faces one crisis after another during changing times. She is a pragmatist and the evolution of life at Downton is often because of her. Lord Grantham's wife Cora is an American, played by Elizabeth McGovern, whose fortune was used to rescue Downton from a low ebb. She has made the transition to a British country estate as a gracious and elegant woman who can also exercise her authority when the need arises to restore order to the household. The rivalry between Maggie Smith and Penelope Wilton is a source of entertainment and much tension. Maggie Smith is the perfect dowager countess, out of touch with the changing times, but certainly not out of touch with what's happening in her own world. She is the most popular of the cast and with good reason. Not only is her acting top-notch but her lines are easily the best written and most pointed. Penelope Wilton, as Isobel Crawley, represents the reforming zeal of the new age, which draws battle lines with the dowager. The clash of wits and strong opinions produces sparks but builds strong respect on both sides.Dan Stevens plays her son, the dashing boy wonder Matthew Crawley, whose personal fortune plays into the plot. The only badly-cast role is that of Shirely McLaine as Cora's mother, a wealthy widow from New York who drips with sarcasm and contempt when she visits Downton. Lord Grantham and his mother the Dowager Countess can barely tolerate her obnoxious behaviour. Hardly a role worthy of McLaine's vast talent. However, her good hearted nature does come out in a crisis and there are hard truths in her criticisms of Downton's traditions and English society in general. Other actors include Jim Carter as Carson, the head butler, who is more than a capable successor to Angus Hudson on Upstairs Downstairs. Phyllis Logan as Mrs. Hughes, oversees the household staff and is a disciplinarian with a heart of gold. I could go on and on with the names of everyone on the cast. Suffice to say, this Masterpiece Theatre production is one superb presentation, with its landscape photography, great costumes, and a story that keeps you wanting to tune in to the next episode. A great yarn taking place over many years, it appears to be headed for a number of seasons. The show does have its share of tragedy so be prepared for the ups and downs on this roller-coaster of a show.",positive
"I enjoyed the first season of Downton Abbey, despite the cartoonesque characters. They were really unidimensional caricatures in the beginning. Then what appears to have happened is that the writer, Julian Fellowes, realized that he had to throw in some twisters to string along the viewers through another season.The problem was that changing the characters to be less of caricatures and more like real human beings also made some of them rather incoherent, Mary being a case in point. The storyline started to oscillate almost sinusoidally. By now, having just finished watching the first episode of Season 3, in which Shirley Maclaine appears to reestablish the importance of caricatures--she being the obnoxious nouveau riche American who has crossed the ocean to attend the wedding of Matthew and Mary--I fear that much, much more incoherence lies ahead.My prediction: Mr. Bates will be revealed to be a serial killer or something along those lines. Obviously he killed his wife Vera, the only question being: how many others????? Will the bones of his victims be found literally in his closet by Anna? Only time will tell. Perhaps Anna will discover that she is really a man trapped in a woman's body and seek a sex change. There must be something wrong with this happy loving couple, because they have been incessantly painted as saints in servants' clothing.Why has this series been so highly acclaimed? It's puzzling in some ways, but I believe that I may have discovered the answer. Think about the people who watch Downton Abbey. They hail nearly entirely from the middle class. This series is beloved to the middle class because it reveals how lucky we are not to be a part of the rigid class system depicted. We are neither wealthy aristocrats nor their servants. That is why we enjoy watching Downton Abbey. It makes us feel a bit like we do while watch The Wire, except that the world to which we gain voyeuristic access is not a housing project in Baltimore, but the village of the Grantham clan.Downton Abbey could also be compared to bad reality television. There is quite a lot of bad acting--with Cora topping the list of characters who should have been finished off by the Spanish flu. The plot twists are somewhat juvenile and ridiculous, too. And has this clan never heard of genetics? It's 1920, and Mary and Matthew are cousins preparing to wed (so that Mary will not lose the estate which her father has already lost through bad investments during the war--like I was saying, incoherent plot twists...) and produce cyclops babies with two heads or perhaps they'll have three breasts or hemophilia. Who knows? They have not a clue. The probability of two deadly or deformative recessive genes combining with devastating effects is much, much higher in such cases of inbreeding. Wasn't this discovered in the nineteenth century?I'll continue to watch for the chuckles for now. Violet is always good for a snarky laugh. ----------------------- Update: I made it through half of season 4 and have now thrown in the tea towel. The remaining characters are cringe worthy and the plots have just become too pathetic. Sorry, fans.My rating plummeted by two stars with each successive season. Not a masterpiece. Not even close.",negative
"My history of the MEN IN BLACK franchise is rather chequered. I didn't care much for the first film and actively hated the second; the third one, complete with its time travelling plotline, was actually my favourite of the trilogy. I had no great hopes for INTERNATIONAL, the fourth instalment carrying on the universe but without the cast, and I was right. This is a perfunctory CGI adventure which boasts a typically charming and funny performance from Chris Hemsworth and nothing else at all. Tessa Thompson tries hard but fails in an underwritten role, while others like Liam Neeson and Emma Thompson are just there to pick up the pay cheque. The CGI effects seem worse than they did in the earlier films, and the whole plot is tired and predictable. Skip it!",negative
"In New York, Molly Wright (Tessa Thompson) is obsessed with extraterrestrial aliens since twenty years earlier when she helped one as a child and witnessed Men in Black neuralysing her parents. She infiltrates MIB headquarters and Agent O (Emma Thompson) reluctantly assigns her as a probational agent. She is sent to the London office which is run by Agent High T (Liam Neeson). Agent H (Chris Hemsworth) is a local legend after he and High T stopped the Hive three years earlier.When a franchise grows tired, it often takes off on a trip to an exotic location. This has that vibe although there are some differences. The biggest is that Will Smith is no longer with the franchise. I am more and more convinced that he is a corner stone and taking him away risks toppling the whole thing. I don't hate anything in this movie. I like Tessa and I like Chris. I like Tessa's story. I like almost everything but it's missing something. It's missing its beating heart. Every moment in this movie has a hollowness like a piece of the screen is simply blank. The other issue is that it doesn't expand the franchise other than going to a fake Europe. It's a rehashing with new people.",negative
"The franchise ""Men in Black: International"" is an entertaining and funny adventure. MIB films with Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are certainly superior but this new movie is worthwhile watching. Chris Hemsworth performing Agent H and Tessa Thompson in the role of the rookie Agent M show good chemistry and are responsible for some hilarious moments while Emma Thompson and Liam Neeson give the necessary credibility to the agency.

"You know a film is in trouble when two of the main stars turned up on the film set bringing their own writers to fix issues with the script.The original Men in Black managed to deliver an exciting film in 90 minutes.30 minutes into this film I was wondering where was the plot?The film starts with young Molly Wright in New York who encountered an alien and saw her parents being neulayzed by the MIB. The adult Molly (Tessa Thompson) has spent years trying to join the MIB and succeeds after she infiltrates its headquarters.Agent O (Emma Thompson) assigns her as a probationary agent to the London office which is run by Agent High T (Liam Neeson.)

He is killed by alien twins.Agent H is arrogant and a bit of a slacker on the job and Agent High T always covers up for him. However it turns out that someone within MIB might be a traitor.The Men in Black films run out of steam with the sequel in 2002. This one does not even get out of the starting blocks. To call it a tired retread is an insult to a tired retread.The best thing about Men in Black: International was an anecdote from Ed Solomon who wrote the first movie. He was in a profit share for Men in Black which grossed over $500 million worldwide.Each year he recieves a letter from Columbia Pictures informing him that as Men in Black has not yet made a profit, there is no money for him to receive. Solomon said in advance of the release of the third sequel, this is proof that Columbia Pictures are in it for the art and not money. I think he was being ironic.",negative
"This appears to be a continuation of the series and not a reboot. Frank, the pug is in this one as what appears to be the lone returning player.

Impressed with her efforts, Emma Thompson makes her an agent. As agent M she goes to London and work for agent High T (Liam Neeson) and with agent H (Chris Hemsworth). She chose him. She has that Harry Potter type reputation as being the only one ever to find MIB and they expect great things from her. And then they save the world.Didn't have the Smith and Jones chemistry and banter, but the couple worked together in an acceptable manner and the dialogue picked up once ""Pawny"" came into the film. The alien club scene would have been better if they had played the cantina music from 'Star Wars."" Alien characters lacked the appeal of previous features.",negative
"So two of the main Thor characters star in this and you can tell they have chemistry together. You should also be able to tell that this is a light affair. A movie that does not aim for excellence, but just is there to entertain you. Chris Hemsworth does, what Chris Hemsworth - well is known for. Being the funny and flirty guy who's good looking.If you lower your expectations (if you even had any) and don't expect this to be anything else than it actually is, you'll have fun. There is a weird cameo of a German soccer/football star in it - not sure if they have different cameos in different countries, but I wonder if other viewers will be stunned or irritated if not.

"The first Men in Black is fantastic, the second one is disappointing, and the third is reasonably good, it is most likely this fourth movie was made to refresh the franchise, and make some money, I knew it had mixed to negative reviews, but I was always going to see it, directed by F.

She manages to track down an alien landing and, dressed in black herself, finds and sneaks into MIB headquarters in New York. She is caught entering the agency, but Molly makes an impression on the head, Agent O (Emma Thompson), arguing she has the skills, having found out about the agency's existence and having no life outside, making her an ideal candidate. Molly convinces Agent O to award her probationary agent status as ""Agent M"" and assigned to the London branch of the organisation. In London, M head of the London branch High T (Liam Neeson), and manages to arrange for herself to be assigned to assist Agent H (Chris Hemsworth). M and H meet with alien royal family member Vungus the Ugly (Kayvan Novak), also a close friend of H, but he is fatally injured by mysterious alien twins who can manifest as pure energy. Vungus passes a strange crystal on to M before he dies, claiming that he cannot trust H, saying he has changed since they last met. Agent C (Rafe Spall) is disappointed with H's dealing of the situation, but M points out that few knew Vungus' location when he was attacked, leading to the conclusion that there is a traitor in MIB. High T assigns C and M to investigate, while H is demoted to desk duty. DNA traces the mysterious twins to the Hive, a parasitic race who invade other planets by merging with the DNA of the conquered species. M learns that H and High T fought off the Hive invasion at the Eiffel Tower in 2016, since then H has developed an uncaring attitude towards his duties and Hight T has helped him to keep his job due to the soft spot they have for each other. H convinces M to join him in following up a lead in Marrakesh, where they recover ""Pawny"" (Kumail Nanjiani), a talking chess piece, the last survivor of a small group of aliens who were attacked by the Twins, he pledges new loyalty to M. But they are subsequently trapped by MIB agents, as video evidence has been recovered of Vungus passing the crystal to M, they suspect she is the traitor. H, M and Pawny manage to escape on rocket-powered bikes, and they learn that the crystal Vungus gave M is a powerful weapon. After crashing the bikes, H's alien contact manages to steal the weapon and take it to Riza Stavros (Rebecca Ferguson), an alien arms merchant and H's ex-girlfriend. H, M and Pawny travel to Riza's island fortress, and try to infiltrate the base to recover the weapon but are caught by Riza and her bodyguard. However, the bodyguard turns out to be the alien that M rescued as a child, he allows them to leave while he keeps Riza contained. The three are cornered by the Twins once again, but the twins are killed by High T and a group of agents. Although the case appears to be concluded, H and M review the evidence, it turns out the Twins required the weapon to use against the Hive rather than to use it for the Hive, and the only evidence of Hive DNA was provided by High T. Agent C concedes that the evidence suggests that High T has been deceptive, he allows H and M to follow High T to the Eiffel Tower. They travel to an extra-terrestrial wormhole and confront Hight T, and it revealed that H was neuralysed to erase the memory of the activities of the Hive, and High T is one of them. The High T/Hive hybrid activates the wormhole to draw the Hive to Earth, but H is able to draw out High T's true personality long enough for M to use the weapon to destroy High T and eradicate the Hive infestation. With the truth of High T's conversion exposed, Agent O joins H and M in Paris, she grants M full MIB agent status and appoints H as the probationary head of the London branch. Also starring Laurent and Larry Bourgeois as the Alien Twins, Kayvan Novak as Nasr / Bassam, Spencer Wilding as Luca Brasi, Marcy Harriell as Molly's Mom, Inny Clemons as Molly's Dad, and Tim Blaney as Frank the Pug. Hemsworth knowingly mocks his own sex appeal, Thompson does well as the young and plucky newbie agent, they are best known as Thor and Valkyrie together in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, so they remain a good duo, and Emma Thompson and Neeson are fine. The special effects are certainly fantastic, the first twenty minutes of the young female character being initiated is interested, and there are some reasonable chase and fight sequences, but the story is flat and full of predictability, and it has hardly any wit and humour, only a joke about Piers Morgan an alien makes you titter, a disappointing very average science-fiction action comedy. Okay!",positive
"So this was a reboot? It really didn't feel like a reboot, especially since there was a painting of Agents Kay and Jay hanging on the wall...Nevertheless, this 2019 addition to the ""Men In Black"" franchise was actually a nice surprise, especially since I didn't really have much of any high expectations to the movie given the fact it had Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson on the cast list. Glad that I was convinced to go to the cinema with the family to watch it, because it turned out that ""Men In Black: International"" was actually rather enjoyable.Now, the storyline is pretty straight forward, much akin to what it was in the previous three movies. The Earth is under an intergalactic threat of grand proportions and it is up to a few good men - and women - to stop the extraterrestrial threat and save the Earth. Yeah, it's been seen and done before.Akin to the previous movies in the franchise, ""Men In Black: International"" is laced with comedy and lots of great special effects. It is, in fact, what characterizes the movies, isn't it?And I will say that both Tessa Thompson and Chris Hemsworth actually managed to portray Agents M and H respectively quite well and actually were nicely cast for the movie. And the movie also benefited from having the likes of Liam Neeson and Emma Thompson on the cast list as well.The special effects in ""Men In Black: International"" were phenomenal, not that there was any doubt that they wouldn't be, given the premise of the previous three movies. Lots of great ideas and good alien concepts. And, like the previous movies, pay close attention to the backgrounds of the movie as well, because there is so much happening and so many nice touches and creatures to be seen.I was genuinely entertained and amused throughout the course of ""Men In Black: International"" and if you enjoyed the previous movies in the franchise, then you definitely also should go to watch this one.",positive
"This film tells the two agents who deal with the latest extraterrestrial situation.The film surpasses my expectations. It is really fun and entertaining. Chris and Tessa are great as the new agents, and they give the franchise a fresh start. Pawny is cute and adorable. I am looking forward to a sequel already!",positive
"In our age of reboots and reimagining's it was only a matter of time before the 'Men in Black' franchise returned. And it returns with mixed results.The major plus of this film is the chemistry between Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson, which manages to carry the films overlong length and weaker moments.Sadly though they are lumbered with a overcomplicated plot, and a script that feels too quippy for its own good. Apparently there were issues in the making of this film, and it does show.If you can get over the fact that Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones don't return, and that this is a whole new version of MiB you should be fine, but there was a sort of charm about the original films that makes this look weaker in comparison.",negative
"Money Can't Buy You Love or a Successful Entertainment.Vacuous and Void of Engaging Content.This is a Cut-and-Paste Picture with Nothing Behind its Lyin' Eyes. A Recycled Movie Without Inspiration, Imagination, or any Endearing Qualities.Formula Based on the Malibu Comics that was Based on the Real-Life (do your research) Men in Black.The Two Leads Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson do a Good Job of seeming Not to Care One-Bit about the Movie.Reciting Their Lines Without Regards to Anything Going On around Them or the Meaning and Purpose of the Whole Thing.Plenty of CGI for the Ho-Hum that it has Become.For Example, the High-Tech Weapons Hidden in the Car Scene is about as Exciting as an Egg-Salad Sandwich.Speaking of Exciting. Chris Hemsworth is Becoming as Overused as James Franco was for a Period of Time.He should Back-Off a Bit and Rethink Over-Exposure.Are You Listening Liam Neeson (after Taken 2 & 3 you should be).Not Much to Offer Fans of the Franchise or the General Public.Just a Mind-Numbing Ineptitude on Display as Product.Content by Committee Guaranteed to Cause a Yawn.",negative
"Good idea - let's refreshen the cast, relocate to jolly-old England and hopefully we can re-ignite this tiring format. Well, wrong! All of that might have worked if the special effects and alien creepy-crawlies were supported by a decent STORY. Alas, not to be. This bumbles along entirely supported by Chris Hemsworth - and there are limits to even his charismatic skills. Please let this be an end, or we will all be heading to the transporter pad with our Marlboro Lights!",negative
". . . which featured ""Blue Light Specials."" It's somewhat shocking in this Modern Age to find a ""blue light special"" at the center of MEN IN BLACK: INTERNATIONAL. K-Mart went belly-up because its blue light offers were not so special, but at least that general retailer was far more plausible than MIBI. This flick displays a ""highly-compressed blue giant star"" about the size of a rotten cantaloupe at the center of a plastic super-soaker spray gun which any Size 1 dame can easily wave around with one arm. Since compression does NOT change gross weight (or mass), this magical weapon's virtually incalculable tonnage would actually contract our solar system into a lifeless ball of fire in less than a nanosecond! Not only have the writers of MIBI flunked the Physics 101 Mid-term, circa 1850, but they'll also lose their shirts in plagiarism law suits IF anyone connected to the STAR TREK franchise gives this lame outing a glance. ""The Hive"" is the only other salient aspect of MIBI beyond its moldy muskmelon, and that entity is indistinguishable from a Trekkie's ""Borg.""",negative
"What starts out looking like standard fare turns out to be a potential threat. Who can solve the mystery? Well, here's who'll have to: Agents H( Hemsworth, who used to be capable, now he's let himself go) and M(Tessa Thompson, who spent 20 years looking for proof, and is on a probationary period, determined to prove herself).The two Leads have a buddy cop/romantic comedy vibe, and excellent chemistry. Pawny(Nanjiani, devoted to her, despising him, and very happy to express both, as a literal living chess piece who has lost his queen, and thus very briefly his purpose, until he accepts her as the new one to serve) is a real standout, consistently hilarious, particularly when they all find themselves having to repair a vehicle. All three improvise lines really well, as do others, such as Spall(a consummate professional who occasionally gets remarkably petty). The script has some interesting ideas. This does not feel like it's just trying to do the first movie over again, like the second one. It's about as good as the third one, and is definitely not on the level of the original. The direction is very capable, albeit workmanlike.Unfortunately, that is all the good that there is to say. About half of the comedy just is not funny. A lot about this is incredibly bland, including the villains. It feels like a bunch of executives determined every aspect of this based on what audiences have responded to in other films. There is passion in parts of this and pay-cheque-cashing in others. Riza(Ferguson, who I'm not certain if she is a great if unconventional choice who has fun hamming it up as an alien, or is terribly miscast and, poor dear, flailing due to her inexperience with this sort of role. She definitely gives it a shot, throwing herself into it) is a mild letdown after a lot of build-up.I recommend this to those who very badly want another entry in this franchise. Personally, if they make more, I'll keep watching, but if this is the last they make, at least for a long time, it's not going to give me sleepless nights. 7/10",positive
"MIB is back for a fourth turn and now they are international. No longer in America or just the streets of New York, these niftily dressed good guys travel all over the globe. This MIB gave a go at showing how expansive the MIB network is and how elaborate their operation is.Agents H and M (Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson) have to find out the reason behind the death of a VIA (very important alien). The fate of the world could be at stake.For me, the movie boiled down to one thing: no Will Smith. Tessa and Chris together don't equal one Will Smith. The Smith/Jones tandem was great. You had Smith as the young, slightly animated comic relief and Jones as the elder straight man. Hemsworth and Thompson didn't have the same appeal. At times, it seemed like they were trying too hard to be what Will Smith was naturally. The story was cool, the special effects of course were nice, I just wasn't feeling the main characters.To be fair, many sequels struggle even with the same characters. And the sequels with different main characters are almost assured failures. So, I guess, all things considered... this wasn't bad.",negative
"Greetings again from the darkness. This is the era of sequels and spin-offs, and every studio dreams of franchises they can squeeze for profit again and again. The 4th entry in the MIB franchise {MEN IN BLACK (1997), MEN IN BLACK II (2002), MEN IN BLACK 3 (2012)}, is certainly more spinoff than sequel, although there is a nugget that ties it to the earlier versions. While we get a new cast and a new director, there are plenty of familiar elements to satisfy loyal fans, although winning new ones may be less likely.Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson are reunited from THOR: RAGNAROK and AVENGERS: ENDGAME to take the leads as Agent H and Agent M, respectively. Replacing the chemistry of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones is a pretty tough challenge, even for two likeable and talented actors. Because of that, it probably makes sense that director F. Gary Gray (STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON, 2015) and co-writers Matt Holloway and Art Marcum (also co-writers on the original IRON MAN, 2008) take the film in a slightly different direction. There are two key story lines: discovering the ""mole"" within MIB, and protecting the world's most dangerous weapon from falling into the wrong hands.Hemsworth overplays his dashing, somewhat inept super agent (a cross between Bond and Clouseau) who charms his way out of every situation, and even though he doesn't fit the MIB we are accustomed to, he's fun to watch and good for some laughs. Ms. Thompson (so good in CREED) is the brainy rookie who spends two decades trying to maneuver herself into a position at MIB, and once she does, it's clear she belongs. Back from the third film is Emma Thompson as Agent O, a senior MIB manager who interviews and hires Molly. Rafe Spall is Agent C, Agent H's internal adversary, and Liam Neeson is High T, the bureau chief. Rebecca Ferguson appears as Riza, Agent H's handsy former squeeze turned villain in a cool fortress. Dancing twins Laurent and Larry Bourgeois play two shape-shifters (a description that doesn't do justice to their skills).The story bounces from Paris to Brooklyn to London to Marrakesh to Paris to Naples. It's a pretty wild adventure with the snazzy guns and futuristic vehicles we've come to expect. In fact, the Lexus reps the brand quite nicely. Molly's backstory is provided early on as the kind of kid who reads Hawking's ""A Brief History of Time"" in bed, and the film offers some clever touches with office artwork and the early years of MIB (Gustave Eiffel), but overall it just seems to be missing something. Fortunately, while H and M are saving the world, Kumail Nanjani as Pawny (voice) is saving the film. His little character provides the most laughs and the most creative punchlines. The franchise has enough of a loyal following that the film should do fine, however it will be surprising if this one can replicate the success of the first 3 films ... although, you guessed it, the sequel to the spin-off is set up.",negative
"The Men in Black have expanded to cover the globe but so have the villains of the universe.To keep the world safe, Agent Thor and rookie Valkyrie join forces.When aliens that can take the form of any human arrive on Earth, H and M (not the clothing company) embark on a globe-trotting adventure to save the world from their mischievous plans.Oh, and there is a mole in the MIB, who could it be? could it be one of the A-listers guest starring in this??MIB: International is a film made for people who thought the chemistry between Hemsworth and Thompson (not Emma) in Ragnarok was second to none. This is true, but they forgot to bring the writers this time.But, the studio didn't forget the cheque book, as we are treated to some sumptuous visuals in Marrakech, which really make the film worth watching.Other than that, it's just an excuse for Hemsworth and Thompson (not Emma) to have that buddy cop banter that we all loved in the eighties when Gibson and Glover were doing it so much better.Plot wise? It's all about a big gun that can destroy the earth, and the bad guys want it, and H and M try throughout the film to keep it from them.Every now and again, we have Liam Neeson barking Basil Exposition from his office, and Rafe Spall trying to get one over Chris Hemsworth every chnac ehe can.It's all predictable stuff, but it looks good, and Hemsworth and Thompson (not Emma) are quite brilliant together.And the film is book ended by a guest appearance from Thompson (Emma, not Tessa).So it's not Thor-ful, but far from Marvel-ous....",negative
I couldn't follow what was going on in the story. Felt like gibberish after a while. Chris Hemsworth doesn't have comedic timing and he rushes his dialog. Should speak slower and clearly. Can't make out what he says. Tessa and him don't have much chemistry.Nice scenery in exotic locations.,negative
"What do you expect from a MiB movie? Weird aliens, ridiculous technology, funny comebacks, people getting hurled into stuff and then getting up like nothing ever happened and a pretty err...black and white situation where the heroes save the day. That's exactly what this is. Back in the day you got Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith on a father son vibe, now you get Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson on a sexual tension vibe and if any more movies will be made, you will probably see the same recipe of experienced but blaze agent and an enthusiastic young rookie, on a father and son sexual vibe, perhaps.The film is exactly what you would expect in this #metoo anti-Chinese climate: no Chinese pandering, a woman in a leading role, some ""why is MiB called MEN in black"" jokes and the latest CGI tech. But it's fun. And if you turn your brain off, like you're supposed to, be a nice lad now, you will enjoy it.",positive
"If you are remotely expecting anything above average, go back to part two.Is this good? Eh. Is it Great? No. Is it bad? Nope. It's just...there. Just...serviceable.I loved the original MIB, was mixed on the sequel and actually, the third was quite entertaining. Why? Both Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith had the 100% charisma going for them. There IS NOT ONE SINGLE PERSON OR FAKE-LOOKING CGI ALIEN IN THIS MOVIE THAT'S REMOTELY AS GOOD AS either Jones or Smith. They weren't bad in this movie, but just did the adequate amount of work.I won't even go deep into explaining the plot except the least interesting main lead tracks down MIB to join them into becoming something very uninteresting. From there, it's a typical MIB storyline and you'll just have to blah your way through.Mercifully, I had a 7-day Starz trial to see this for ""free."" I'd be kinda pissed if I had to pay for it. Again, it's not terrible, but I would never recommend it. Just be like Jason Bourne and wait for the inevitable Part V with the return of Jones/Smith.And don't get me started on those Matrix Twin Villains. I hated them and missed the Matrix sequel who portrayed them much better.***Final thoughts: I MUCH prefer these actors in Thor: Ragnarök. I understand they tried to strike lightening twice in their bottle...but the Hammer had already been destroyed while this was being made.",positive
This could have been so much better. it was predictable with a bland story. the special effects were awesome. it was pretty funny. the leads were likable. the comedic relief alien wasn't funny. some dumb moments. but i enjoyed most of it. (1 viewing 10/26/19),positive
"I loved the original 'Men in Black' film and, contrary to the majority, I really enjoyed the two sequels that followed (I clearly had low expectations for them!). Plus, who can dislike Chris Hemsworth right now? He's one of the coolest, most charismatic actors working in Hollywood right now. I avoided most reviews before I watched this 'International' version, but I sort of heard that the opinion on whether this incarnation was any good was quite split down the middle.First of all, it is a direct sequel to part 3, i.e. it set in the same universe/timeline, but no appearances from either Will Smith or Tommy Lee Jones to be found. I thought it was worth noting that point in these days of reboots, soft reboots and re-imaginings etc. Chris Hemsworth is already working for the shadowy agency who protects the general public from knowing about all the alien life coming and going from Earth and Tessa Thompson is the new recruit he takes under his wing when a new case arises.Apparently, there's something amiss in the MIB's London branch and Tessa Thompson's character, 'M' is sent there to partner up with Chris Hemsworth, 'H' in order to investigate. You get the usual stuff from a 'MIB' movie, i.e. plenty of slick-looking tech and random aliens wandering around. I couldn't help but think that the computer effects used to bring these creatures to life didn't look much better than the CGI first utilised in 1997 in the first outing of the franchise.They soon discover that there's a 'mole' in the agency, working against them from within. This kind of robs the storyline of a definite bad guy. The past three movies had a 'main alien' who they have to catch/fight. I know there are a couple of aliens who - sort of - fit that description, but it's clear that the main 'antagonist' of the story is unseen for the best part. I wouldn't mind that too much if it wasn't for the fact that - to me - the mole was clearly obvious from the start. Okay, to be fair it was a guess between two characters, but one was blatantly too annoying/obvious to actually turn out to be the bad guy.It's fair to say that when watching anything like 'Men in Black' (and almost any science fiction/horror film in general) you need to suspend your disbelief. Here, you REALLY need to suspend your disbelief. In fact, about every five minutes something happened where I totally rolled my eyes and shook my head as one plot device unfolded after the other, simply there to move the story to the next location. People just were able to walk into secret and heavily-guarded facilities at will and no one stopped them. The (so-called) most secretive agency on Earth basically operated in full view of the public and no one called this out. Scenes were set in broad daylight in London, Paris and New York involving lasers and spaceships and yet there wasn't a single civilian anywhere to notice any of these out-of-this-world incidents. Now, I know the two leads have both played superheroes in their time, but these MIB characters are distinctly human. Although, you might not notice based on the amount of punishment they take and then walk away without so much as a scratch.There was definite chemistry between the two leads and the fact they had starred together in the Marvel movies certainly helped. However, I felt that Tessa Thompson's character had a bit of the 'Mary Sue' about her. No, she wasn't half as bad as 'Rey' from the latest 'Star Wars' films, but 'MIB: International' spends much of its runtime telling us how intelligent she is and showing us just how capable she is. When she's left to just interact with her co stars she's really watchable and fun, but every scene seems to lead to something which shows us just how great she is and it all seems a little forced.I'm quite gutted at how many faults I kept picking out. I'm hardly a fussy devote of films. Most of my DVD collection contains cheesy horror and sci-fi, plus tonnes of those films that are just 'so-bad-they're-good' types. For some reason I just felt the writing here was so lazy and people developed new powers that they had never used before just to get themselves out of the latest situation. I like to think I can suspend my disbelief and enjoy a film, but this one was just a little bit too hard to find believable, even in a world as 'make believe' as this.",negative
"Men In Black: International (2019)' doesn't have the charisma of Will Smith or pre-'Men In Black 3 (2012)' Tommy Lee Jones, the chemistry between those two stars or the charm of Barry Sonnenfeld's direction and world-building. Indeed, it's not so much 'MIB' as 'generic action sci-fi'. Still, it's not bad, by any means; if you divorce it of its franchise, it's probably even better. It's a competent, generally enjoyable film with solid performances and a solid story. There are some fun set-pieces, along with the occasional bit of inspired banter, and the central mystery is fairly well handled. Of course, the final 'reveal', if you will, is quite predictable, but that's primarily because it's quite cliché. In fact, the flick does a good job of keeping you on your toes throughout and could have, theoretically, unfolded in a number of ways - most of which would probably have been more interesting, to be fair. However, the villain's ultimate plan has a few 'holes', if you will, and lacks weight overall, feeling like it needs a bit of expansion to both make more sense (primarily in terms of motivation and time-scale) and have a greater impact. The humour also sometimes seems a little off-brand, pushing passed harmless innuendo and heading into darker territory; I mean, there's literally a gag involving what's, essentially, a rape. Typically, though, the piece plays as the buddy-comedy you'd expect. It doesn't do a lot to develop its world (it also seems to misunderstand the need for, or appropriate use of, the 'neuralyzer') and it's pretty much devoid of the prior titles' immigration allegories and imaginative imagery. Generally, it feels fairly generic. Still, it's quite enjoyable when it gets going. After a rushed first act, it moves at a decent pace and includes some interesting ideas. It manages to set itself apart from its predecessors with an intrigue-based plot and a distinct, if less interesting, style. Surely, that's better than a pale imitation or, worse, remake of 'Men In Black (1997)'? Like I said, it's entertaining enough. It's not quite 'MIB', but it's not bad. 6/10",positive
"The worst thing a film can be is forgettable, bland, and unnecessary. Sadly, Men in Black: International falls in line with all 3 of those. After hearing several critics talk about how generic the film was, I tried hard to pay attention to the convoluted plot and even in a movie flooded with actors I enjoy, it had a difficult time keeping my eye. Whether there were as many on set/script/production issues as reported, the movie is still just as unnecessary as we all figured when announced. The better idea would have been to go through with the Jump Street crossover, but my guess would be that the MIB franchise is more than likely dead. Any film that casts Rebecca Ferguson and wastes her talent by simply giving her one 10 minute scene doesn't deserve any attention.4.9/10",negative
"While I know a lot of reviewers liked the 1976 version of ""Midway"", for someone who knows about aircraft, it's a frustrating film. Again and again and again, the film uses old footage...much of which show planes which never fought at this famous sea battle! And, in a few cases, you'd see fighter planes turn into dive bombers and the like....all due to sloppy editing and a 'it's good enough' attitude. Because of this, I strongly recommend you see the 2019 version, which gets around this issue by using CGI...and modern CGI is incredible and looks real. Well made, but not perfect, but a very good film for folks who are interested in war films and history.By the way, I wrote a review for this a few months ago and it never appeared on this site. It was much more detailed...but I just haven't seen it recently enough to review it more in depth.",positive
"MIDWAY is a WW2 epic that's about as good as it has any right to be given that the director is Roland Emmerich. It's one of those ""does what it says on the tin"" type movies in that it gets straight to the heart of the matter, beginning with the attack on Pearl Harbor and moving through the epic naval battle centred around the titular Pacific island. Emmerich's characters are cardboard cut-outs, but at least they're cut-outs occupied by an ensemble cast of familiar Hollywood stars, who have some talent to bring. The plot is lightweight but the action comes thick and fast and the CGI effects are certainly of a superior quality, generally convincing even when watched in high definition on a large television set. Expect plenty of drama, heroics and spectacle to keep the brain occupied, and if it's a little shallow for some tastes, you can rest assured that Emmerich has done much, much worse and that we're lucky to get this kind of standard from him.",positive
